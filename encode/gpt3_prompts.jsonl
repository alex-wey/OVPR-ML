Though Sunshine State voters last fall rejected a broad medical marijuana ballot proposal, a more narrow measure ( Senate Bill 1030 ) was signed by Gov. Rick Scott nearly a year ago. The \"Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act of 2014\" allows some nurseries to grow \"low-THC\" pot and distribute to \"qualified patients\" suffering from cancer, seizures and muscle spasms. But for black growers in the state, \"It's a bad thing,\" said Florida Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association President Howard Gunn Jr. Gunn is referencing one line in the law that is creating controversy. It states farmers must have a license to cultivate \"more than 400,000 plants\" and must have operated \"as a registered nursery in [Florida] for at least 30 continuous years.\" According to Gunn, hardly any black farmers meet that criteria. \"There weren't that many black farmers 30 years ago in the nursery business,\" he said. \"We say they weren't there because of the discriminatory practices set by the USDA.\"", "summary": null}

The same researchers had previously found that marijuana users were at higher risk of cognitive decline and descent into lower social and economic strata, but the new study suggests the same isn't true for physical health. \"The only measures that seemed to indicate any really serious health problem was periodontal disease,\" said senior author Terrie Moffitt, of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. In periodontal disease, the gums around the teeth become inflamed, according to the National Institutes of Health. The gums pull away from the teeth, creating pockets that can become infected. Left untreated, periodontitis can lead to loss of teeth. For the new study, the researchers studied 1,037 people born in New Zealand in 1972 and 1973. Participants were tracked from age 3 to age 38. Overall, about 65 percent reported using marijuana at some point after age 18, according to the results in JAMA Psychiatry.", "summary": null}

The Highway Loss Data Institute, a leading insurance research group, said in study results released Thursday that collision claims in Colorado, Washington, and Oregon went up 2.7 percent in the years since legal recreational marijuana sales began when compared with surrounding states. Legal recreational pot sales in Colorado began in January 2014, followed six months later in Washington, and in October 2015 in Oregon. \"We believe that the data is saying that crash risk has increased in these states and those crash risks are associated with the legalization of marijuana,\" said Matt Moore, senior vice president with the institute, which analyzes insurance data to observe emerging auto-safety trends. Mason Tvert, a marijuana legalization advocate and communications director with the Marijuana Policy Project, questioned the study's comparison of claims in rural states such as Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana with Colorado, Oregon and Washington that have dense population centers and how that affected the study's findings. \"The study raises more questions than it provides answers, and it's an area that would surely receive more study, and deservedly so,\" Tvert said.", "summary": null}

Those questions are especially important for one group: pregnant women. Marijuana use during pregnancy is becoming more common , despite the lack of clarity about its possible effects. But today (Aug. 27), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released its first-ever guidelines on marijuana use for pregnant and breast-feeding women. The new recommendations are based on an analysis of the existing research on how marijuana affects pregnancy, breast-feeding and childhood development, and they touch on a range of questions that expectant parents might have. [ 7 Ways Pregnant Women Affect Babies ] Here are the most important takeaways from the report. Don't use marijuana, in any form, during pregnancy. The AAP report concludes that completely avoiding marijuana use during pregnancy is best. That's in part because THC , or tetrahydrocannabinol the compound responsible for marijuana's psychoactive effects can cross the placenta. Several long-term studies have found relationships between marijuana use by pregnant women and slightly shorter gestational periods and lower birth weights, according to the report.", "summary": null}

The drugs were found in the same plant that was recently visited by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO). The discovery took place this week in Cadereyta when Federal Police officers found 45 marijuana plants hidden within the brushy back area of the facility. Cadereyta is approximately 110 miles south from the border city of Reynosa. The refinery is run by controversial state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex). Information provided to Breitbart News by law enforcement sources revealed the plants were initially found by Pemex security guards who contacted federal authorities. The rear part of the facility is federally restricted but rarely supervised, law enforcement sources revealed. In May, AMLO and Nuevo Leon Governor Jaime Rodriguez Calderon visited the refinery to oversee a series of repairs. It remains unclear how federal authorities who oversee AMLOs security missed the grow operation.", "summary": null}
