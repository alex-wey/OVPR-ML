Sadly, Christian bakers Daniel and Amy McArthur from Northern Ireland were taken to court when they refused to make a cake for a gay wedding with a gay marriage slogan. The owners of Belfast-based Ashers Bakery declined an order placed by gay activist Gareth Lee for a cake with a pro-gay marriage slogan, claiming the message was inconsistent with their deeply held religious beliefs. Through the legal proceedings, Asher\u2019s manager Daniel McArthur insisted Mr. Lee\u2019s sexuality was never an issue, rather the message he wanted the bakery to create. If equality law means people can be punished for politely refusing to support other people\u2019s causes, then equality law needs to change,\u201d-Mr. McArthur said. This ruling undermines democratic freedom. It undermines religious freedom. It undermines free speech. He added: What we refused to do was to be involved with promoting a political campaign to change marriage law in Northern Ireland.\u201d \u201cBecause we\u2019re Christians, we support the current law and we felt that making this cake would make us responsible for its message.\u201d \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t decorate a cake with a pornographic picture or with swear words. We wouldn\u2019t even decorate a cake with a spiteful message about gay people because to do so would be to endorse and promote it.\u201d He added: \u201cIn the meantime, other businesses will have to take advice about whether they have to refuse orders that conflict with their conscience or whether they have to be coerced as well into promoting other people\u2019s views.\u201d But unfortunately, the judge ruled against them and didn\u2019t accept their defense that making this cake would go against their religious beliefs. The rights of the customer to demand any type of cake trumped their right to practice their religion in their own business. However, this hasn\u2019t impacted their profits. The couple has seven outlets throughout the UK and the Republic of Ireland. And their 2016 profits were almost $300,000 higher than the prior years. They may have lost in court, but standing up for their rights and principles apparently has been good for their business!

The couples, working with Immigration Equality, a gay rights group that focuses on immigration, brought the case before US District Court yesterday. They argued that the Defense of Marriage Act discriminates against non-citizens in same-sex marriages who might wish to gain legal residence in the US. Salon's Glenn Greenwald, who is forced to live in Brazil with his same-sex partner as a result of the Defense of Marriage Act, said \"[t]his is one of those injustices so extreme and indefensible that it\u2019s difficult, at least for me, to avoid high levels of anger when discussing, and it\u2019s even more difficult to understand how any person could favor its continuation.\" Five same-sex couples challenged a U.S. law barring the federal government from recognizing gay marriages, saying its impact is harsh on non-citizens' spouses. The lawsuit challenging the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, was filed Monday by Immigration Equality in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. \"I'm a citizen of this country just like anybody else,\" Heather Morgan, 36, a plaintiff in the lawsuit with her spouse, Maria del Mar Verdugo Yanez, who is from Spain, told The New York Times. \"I'm very proud of this country. I don't want to feel like I have to leave here in order to be with the person I love. I shouldn't have to choose.\" Most of the immigrants have been in the United States legally on temporary visas that will expire soon, the Times said. Under immigration law, a citizen can apply for a foreign spouse to gain legal permanent residency, experts said. However, federal authorities do not recognize same-sex marriages under DOMA, leaving same-sex couples with the choice of deportation for the immigrant or exile for the American. Immigration Equality Executive Director Rachel Tiven said the organization urged federal officials to suspend deportations of immigrants in same-sex marriages as court challenges to DOMA worked through the legal system, but the authorities declined, prompting the lawsuit, the Times said. In February 2011, the Obama administration announced that it considered the key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutionally discriminatory, and that officials no longer would defend it in the courts. Five legally married same-sex couples filed a lawsuit on Monday to challenge the 1996 law that bars the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, arguing that its impact is particularly harsh on couples that include an American citizen and a foreigner.", "summary": "Gay rights group brings lawsuit; claims DOMA treats non-citizens unfairly"}

Aaron Klein, co-owner of Sweet Cakes, by Melissa, dropped a check off for $136,927.07, according to the Bureau of Labor and Industries. The payment includes interest. Klein also paid $7,000 earlier this month. Damages were award in July for emotional suffering caused by the bakery which refused to make a wedding cake for Laurel and Rachel Bowman-Cryer more than two years ago. The bakers said they refused to make the cake because of their religious beliefs. The dispute goes back to January 2013 when Bowman-Cryer came into the shop with her mother for a cake-tasting appointment. However, Aaron Klein told the women that the bakery didn\u2019t do cakes for same-sex weddings. The women filed complaints with the state and triggered a national debate over claims of religious beliefs against anti-discrimination laws. Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian awarded the damages nearly six months ago, saying the owners had violated the women\u2019s civil rights by discriminating on the basis of their sexual orientation. They were also slapped with a gag order that prohibited them from speaking publicly about their refusal to participate in or bake wedding cakes for same-sex marriages. Aaron and his wife Melissa filed an appeal of the ruling and were defying the order to pay the damages before Monday. Tyler Smith, an attorney representing the Kleins, told The Oregonian that his clients have not abandoned their appeal of Avakian\u2019s order. Smith said it was in their clients\u2019 best interests to pay now rather than wait for the appeal date, which is slated for next year. The Oregonian reported the state has received a total of $144,000 from the Kleins. Charlie Burr, an agency spokesman, told the paper the payment might be more than what they owe. \"We have been in touch with their lawyers throughout the process,\" Burr said. The amount might differ because of the accruing interest, according to the paper. A 2007 Oregon law protects the rights of gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people in employment, housing and public accommodations. The state ruled it also bars private businesses from discriminating against potential customers.", "summary": null}

State marriage equality laws enacted in the years before the 2015 Supreme Court ruling were linked to lower rates of suicide attempts among all high school students but especially among teens who identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual or unsure. Ultimately, the researchers found, for every year that same-sex marriage laws were in place, 134,000 fewer teens attempted suicide. This is noteworthy because queer teens are more than four times as likely to attempt suicide as their straight peers. While the study doesn\u2019t demonstrate that these laws actually caused a reduction in suicide attempts, lead study author Julia Raifman theorized that having equal protection under the law may account for much of the change. \u201cThese are high school students so they aren\u2019t getting married any time soon, for the most part,\u201d said Raifman, a post-doctoral fellow at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, in a statement about her research. \u201cStill, permitting same-sex marriage reduces structural stigma associated with sexual orientation. There may be something about having equal rights \u2015 even if they have no immediate plans to take advantage of them \u2015 that makes students feel less stigmatized and more hopeful for the future.\u201d Raifman\u2019s theory is an important measure in this new political climate. Same-sex marriage is now federal law, thanks to the 2015 Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges, but there are worrying signs that Republican politicians may start to undermine the right to marriage and LGBTG protections in general, both at the state and federal levels. Studies like this one show that equal marriage rights benefit those who want to marry someone of the same gender but also improve mental health for everyone, especially queer teens. \u201cPolicymakers need to be aware that policies on sexual minority rights can have a real effect on the mental health of adolescents,\u201d she concluded. \u201cThe policies at the top can dictate in ways both positive and negative what happens further down.\u201d Before 2015, only 35 states had legalized same-sex marriage. During this era, Raifman surveyed nearly 800,000 students of all sexual orientations from 1999 to 2015 about suicide attempts both before and after 32 states had legalized same-sex marriage. She also compared teen suicide attempts in states that legalized marriage to those in states that didn\u2019t. Before the passage of same-sex legislation, nearly 9 percent of all teens and nearly 29 percent of queer-identifying teens had attempted suicide.", "summary": "Tolerant societies have healthier, happier citizens.

But I don't see how a reasonable person can disagree with gay marriage. Now, it's one thing if a private Church was being forced to perform gay marriages against it's will, or if a private Christian school was being forced to teach about birth control and homosexuality in sex ed against it's will; I can't condemn protesting against that.

My point of view: this is not a sufficient argument to show that one should oppose changes in the legal definition of marriage, even if one accepts that homosexual acts are condemned. My reasons: The questions \"should I allow myself to do X\" and \"should I allow others to do X\" are separate moral questions. The Bible often draws this distinction - in fact, Christians who feel compelled for religious reasons to impose dietary restrictions on themselves are explicitly warned not to try to impose them on others. It does not automatically follow, even if you are certain that gay sex is wrong, that it is your personal mission to prevent others from engaging in it. The questions \"Should I allow other Christians to do X\" and \"Should I allow unbelievers to do X\" are, in Biblical ethics, separate moral questions. For example, believers are warned to separate themselves from people who claim to be Christians but engage in sexual immorality, but in the same passage told that it's fine to be friends with sexually immoral unbelievers. Therefore, it does not automatically follow that convictions about God's opinion on gay, sexually active Christians has anything at all to do with how you should treat gay, sexually active non-Christians. Thirdly, the Bible says nothing explicit about homosexual marriage. It may be something that the early Christians never thought of (though one would presume God knew about the issue). The Biblical arguments about same-gender marriage, generally, derived from passages stating that God ordained marriage, and the wording of these passages indicate two different genders. Also, since marriage is a metaphor for the relationship between Christ and the church (this is in the Bible), marriage is a holy institution (this is also in the Bible), and therefore should not be \"split apart\". However, this has little to do with how secular governments define marriage - in the context of those passages, the Bible is specifically condemning divorce between Christians. In fact, the Bible even permits a believer, abandoned by an unbelieving spouse, to remarry (\"the brother or sister is not bound in such circumstances\" 1 Cor 7:15).", "summary": null}

What I hate is the attempt to place same sex marriage and traditional marriage on the same level as if they are the same thing. They aren't. I also don't agree with the argument that \"everyone should have the right to marry who they love\". No. You don't have that right. Love is only one factor in marriage. It isn't the only factor. Just because a 15 year old high school student and their teacher fall in love doesn't give them the right to marry. I'm also sure there are weirdos out there who fall in love with a family member. That doesn't give them the right to get married. Marriage is about love, yes. But it's also about being productive members of society and building a healthy biologically created nuclear family unit. Same sex marriages cannot do that for society. It's only second best. It's also not about \"equal rights\". Gay people have the exact same rights that straight people do.

The first point is false, marijuana has some medicinal usages such as helping with pain or appetite in cancer patients. Does marijuana have a high potential for abuse? Well, it certainty has a potential for abuse, but is it really worse than meth, cocaine, or fentanyl (which btw are all Schedule II)?

After the failure of the alcohol prohibition in the states, government officials needed a new enemy: Cannabis. After picking the only negative opinion of a scientist, they proposed it to the Un and they actually agreed (obviously, this is a very simple version of it). Countries like Germany protested but were silenced through it's pharma industry lobbyists, as they saw a danger in this drug making some of their products obsolete. Cannabis can be used as a painkiller, to calm people with behavioral syndromes and some claim even against other diseases. Although it is legalized for medical purposes in some countries, supply is low and the prices ridiculous, as insurances won't pay for it. Cannabis is less harmful than Alcohol and Nicotine. The only risks of consuming it are a psychosis (I'll adress these again) or damaging your lung through smoking (minimized by vaping or edibles). When you're high you drive better and calmer than when you're drunk (driving while high should still be illegal). It destroys a branch of the black market, as people can just buy it (btw. governments can earn millions through taxes). Dealers can't offer you \"harder\" drugs, as you won't be buying from them but from highly regulated official vendors. Through controlling the balance of THC and CBD the danger of psychosis is also lowered. Black market Cannabis tends to have a higher and higher dosis of THC, because it is more efficient and worth more. This means a higher danger of psychosis. With regulated Cannabis though, this problem can be regulated as mentioned above. This is a short version of my argumentation. I am aware that I may have been not accurate enough or not told everything, so you don't have to hate on me.

Another aspect to consider is DUI and other hazards caused by impairment. Our society already has a major problem with drunk driving, so why add high driving into the mixture? The real hazard here comes from how quickly Marijuana acts on the nervous system. While it usually takes 2-3 beers to cause significant impairment, a single hit from a joint is enough to impair most people. Economics. A major arguement for legalization is that revenue from Marijuana will stimulate the economy. And this is true for a short period of time. What people fail to realize however is that Marijuana will negatively impact the consumer in the long term. Money spent on Marijuana is like money spent on Alchohol. Usually when money is exchanged for a good, that product either directly or indirectly assists the comsumer in a meaningful way. Money spent on any drug does not provide significant tangible benefit. A large Marijuana market would serve only to take money from the hands of the consumer while not providing any afforememtioned tangible benefit. Money in the hand of the consumer is what ultimately stimulates the economy, not money in the hands of wealthy Marijuana companies. No turning back. I'm sure you're familiar with prohibition and how that all ended up. What prohibition taught us is that once a product (especially a drug) is introduced into a population, it is EXTREMELY hard to remove that product. The same concept applies to Marijuana. Essentially, once Marijuana is legalized, there is no turning back.", "summary": null}

Dont get me wrong, medicinal marijuana to help aid people who have chronic pain or terminal illnesses is fine. It helps them cope with their condition and, because their illness is terminal, won't affect them later in life. But I feel different about recreational use. I understand a lot of the viewpoints supporting it. It's wrong to persecute and imprison people, especially of color over non violent drug offenses. At the same time, however, a crime is a crime. Knowingly selling and distributing drugs is illegal. I think, perhaps instead, they get fined. But I digress. Marijuana has some serious side effects. Its linked to development problems, cancers and ect. It's basically making a new, potentially more addictive cigarette available to the market. Obviously, normal cigarettes are declining in popularity, but juuling and marijuana use is increasing. This, I fear, will cause another generation of people who will die young and regret ever smoking. Not only this, cigarettes and addictions are costly, and making marijuana legal will just make it easier for people to drain their income. Marijuana is also linked to disorders which cause people to be less active and less willing to work. It's a depressant. So not only will people waste money, they will also produce less money. Like I said, many points supporting it are valid and true. More tax revenue, more potential jobs, less mass incarceration. But I think legalizing it will cause more harm than good. I know there will be some comments like \"but if its legalized it will be more controlled.\" I get that, but, alcohol and juuls are similar, they are controlled, yet dealers and resellers still find a way to the younger market. Overall, the idea to make recreational marijuana legal, is somewhat misleading in its benefits. I'm open minded, and, I'll admit I'm wrong 20 years from now when society is magically transformed and marijuana somehow saved us. But until then, that's my take on it.", "summary": null}

Weed is especially destructive in teenagers\u2019 brains. It leads to less grey matter, more disorganized white matter, working memory and attention deficiencies, and a loss of IQ points (Current Addiction Reports). And legalization makes it easier for teens to acquire; while Colorado has not seen an overall change in teen use since legalization, legalization of medical pot made it more easily accessible for teens. Monitoring the Future also proved that alcohol and marijuana, which are legal and quasi-legal in our society, are far more accessible to teens than hard drugs like heroin and meth, which debunks the myth that simply regulating it will decrease teen usage. It\u2019s similar regarding traffic and the roads. A study from Nova Scotia found that driving under the influence of marijuana doubles the risk of a serious or fatal car accident. Another study found that marijuana-related traffic fatalities tripled from 1999-2010. And that sure has manifested where weed has become legal. In Washington State, traffic fatalities where the driver tested positive for THC doubled after legalization. In Denver, CO, the same occurred, according to data. Many like to point to how alcohol is far more dangerous and how Prohibition was ineffective. Alcohol has been used by Western culture for thousands of years before we were aware of harmful effects. The social culture surrounding it couldn\u2019t be more different. If we invented it today, it would be treated just like any other drug. It\u2019s exactly the reason why we shouldn\u2019t legalize another psychoactive substance that affects behavior. People also do not drink alcohol recreationally exclusively to get high, for which the opposite is true regarding weed. Many also like to point to Portugal\u2019s policy of decriminalization (though it is still strongly discouraged by law enforcement). I\u2019d point to Sweden\u2019s policy in response, as well as Spain\u2019s. It will not lead to significant increases in revenue. It hasn\u2019t in Colorado. It will not have too large an effect on imprisonment, as people are rarely incarcerated solely for possession (Caulkins, Sevigny 1997). It is also rare for police to arrest solely for possession. In fact, drugs are hardly the reason for mass incarceration at all. Abnormally long sentence lengths imposed in the 1980s under Reagan are, and this caused the prison population to climb more than 400%. The original War on Drugs under Nixon, on the contrary, was never about mass imprisonment, but instead focused on treatment, which decreased in the 1980s due to tougher sentence lengths for all crimes in general.", "summary": null}
