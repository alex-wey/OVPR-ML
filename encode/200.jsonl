My point of view: this is not a sufficient argument to show that one should oppose changes in the legal definition of marriage, even if one accepts that homosexual acts are condemned. My reasons: The questions \"should I allow myself to do X\" and \"should I allow others to do X\" are separate moral questions. The Bible often draws this distinction - in fact, Christians who feel compelled for religious reasons to impose dietary restrictions on themselves are explicitly warned not to try to impose them on others. It does not automatically follow, even if you are certain that gay sex is wrong, that it is your personal mission to prevent others from engaging in it.

The first point is false, marijuana has some medicinal usages such as helping with pain or appetite in cancer patients. Does marijuana have a high potential for abuse?
