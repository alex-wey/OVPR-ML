The question to me is whether this interference is really substantial enough to warrant such a potential expansion of powers of the Commerce Clause. I think the reality is that creating a legal medical marijuana market *does* have an impact on the marijuana supply in other states as well. It creates a legal market for a previously illegal good within California. However, this good is easily transferable to out of state (it's not like marijuana expires; and if a medical marijuana license was as easy to obtain as it is today, then the restrictions wouldn't prevent out of staters from getting a license). As such, to me it seems understandable at face value that SCOTUS would be concerned about an over extension of a state's ability to impact out of state markets through such a legalization. Furthermore, since the time of the ruling, what qualifies as interstate commerce has only become more complicated with the advances in technology which have taken place which make it even easier to order goods from out of state. Does the ruling open a potential pandora's box of extending federal government power over the commerce clause? The way that the majority opinions seem to state it, it doesn't necessarily. They leave it rather vague, and seem to only validate such a ruling for a case dealing with specific markets such as illegal substances.", "summary": null}

Now, there is reason to believe heavy consumption of Cannabis at a young age isn't good for you, but we don't yet have enough research to understand the scope and severity of this risk. While heavy use during adolescence does seem to have some impact on neural development, it isn't clear that this is much different than chronic use of other legal substances during that developmental period. Furthermore, there's still a huge outstanding question of whether other variables, such as poverty, social conditions, use of other substances, etc., much actually explain concerning findings better than Marijuana use. I can't claim to be an expert on this topic, but I would definitely recommend reading the APA's [report on current research](), which does a great job summarizing prominent existing literature. In summary, I certainly wouldn't advocate for allowing teens to use cannabis, but I don't think data suggests that legalizing this drug (which would still include age restrictions) would result in citizens with severe impairment to motivation or other cognitive functions.", "summary": null}

Igor Grant, a psychiatrist who directs the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at the University of California, San Diego, said five studies funded by the state involved volunteers who were randomly given real marijuana or placebos to determine if the herb provided relief not seen from traditional medicines. \"There is good evidence now that cannabinoids may be either an adjunct or a first-line treatment,\" Grant said at a news conference where he presented the findings. The California Legislature established the research center in 2000 to examine whether the therapeutic claims of medical marijuana advocates could withstand scientific scrutiny. In 1996, state voters became the first in the nation to pass a law approving pot use for medical purposes. Thirteen other states have followed suit, but California is the only one so far to sponsor medical marijuana research. After 10 years and nearly $9 million, the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research is preparing to wrap up its work next year. Along with the studies on muscle spasms and pain associated with spinal cord injuries and AIDS, the center also has funded research on how marijuana affects sleep and driving, limb pain due to diabetes, and whether inhaling vaporized cannabis is as effective as smoking it. A laboratory study supported by the center examined if pot could be helpful in treating migraine headaches and facial pain. In that study, rats given a cannabis-like drug exhibited reduced activity of nerve cells that transmit pain. State Sen. Mark Leno, a San Francisco Democrat who chairs a budget subcommittee on health and human services and supports medical marijuana, said he doubted there would be more financial support for the center, given California's ongoing budget crisis. The federal government classifies marijuana as an illicit drug with no medical use but produces the only pot legally available for scientific research under a contract with the University of Mississippi. Grant said obtaining some of the Mississippi crop and meeting the complex security regulations required by the Drug Enforcement Agency and other federal agencies was time-consuming and cumbersome. Grant, however, had no problem with the quality of the government's supply. Its consistency was helpful in determining that patients who smoked less-potent marijuana enjoyed the same amount of pain relief but less mental confusion than those who inhaled a more powerful strain, he said. Such quality control is notably absent from the marijuana that patients with a doctor's recommendation can legally obtain in California through hundreds of cooperatives and storefront dispensaries, Grant said. He said more research was needed on how pot works and its side effects. \"Because we don't know the composition of the strains that are on the street, we don't know what patients really are getting,\" he said. \"As a doctor I feel some discomfort when someone says take X or Y pill or herb because we think that might be helpful.\" Since its founding, the center has approved 15 research studies, but five had to be discontinued because there were not enough volunteers willing or able to meet the criteria for participating. One proposed study on the effectiveness of marijuana in reducing chemotherapy-related nausea was canceled because researchers could not recruit enough cancer patients who weren't already treating their symptoms effectively with anti-nausea medications. In the 24-page report submitted Wednesday to the Legislature, Grant said research protocols had been rigorous, with six studies published or accepted for publication in peer-reviewed science journals. In four studies, participants suffering from multiple sclerosis, AIDS or diabetes, along with healthy volunteers injected with a chili pepper substance to induce pain, were randomly assigned to receive cigarettes filled with marijuana. Half had the active ingredient delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, removed. Not every patient who smoked the real marijuana reported improvement. But the percentage who did was comparable to those who said they experienced relief from antidepressants and other medications commonly prescribed for neuropathic pain, the study said.", "summary": null}

As a strong front-runner (and assuming shes running), expect Clinton to avoid positions that she perceives as dangerous in a general election, but also expect her to match Democrats who embrace issues that could divide the party. All of that analysis, for Clinton and the rest, is based on an assumption that candidates will react here to electoral incentives rather than their personal views of the issue. I think thats extremely likely in this case; Id be very surprised if more than a handful of candidates for Congress next year have strong personal feelings on this.

Its not good policy to facilitate the opportunity for more inebriated people to wander among us. Legalizing marijuana is just not a good idea. Even my friend Ruth Marcus at XXX, who is not exactly a conservative commentator, said that widespread legalization is a bad idea, particularly because of the known negative impact smoking marijuana can have on adolescents and their development. She cited a 2012 study that found that persistent cannabis use was associated with neuropsychological decline broadly across domains of functioning. Republicans need to be clear on where they stand on this issue.We shouldnt think up reasons to do the wrong thing to try to look hip or appeal to reckless youth. If the Democrats think they have found an issue for 2014, let them be the ones to promise more pot to the population. And spare me the talk about personal freedom being at stake here. You arent more free if you are a pothead and freedom isnt measured by marijuana consumption.", "summary": null}

The bill, to be introduced by Senators Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), would end the federal ban on medical marijuana and implement a series of reforms long sought by advocates. They include down grading its status with the Drug Enforcement Agency from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2, allowing doctors to recommend its use in some cases to veterans, expanding access to researchers and making it easier for banks to provide services to the industry. The Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States (CARERS) Act would allow patients, doctors and businesses in states that have already passed medical marijuana laws to participate in those programs without fear of federal prosecution, according to a joint statement from the senators offices. The bill will also make overdue reforms to ensure patients including veterans receiving care from VA facilities in states with medical marijuana programs access the care they need. The proposal will be unveiled at a 12:30 p.m. press conference on Tuesday, which will be streamed live here . Patients, their families and advocates will join the senators at the press conference. The announcement was met with praise by advocates. This is a significant step forward when it comes to reforming marijuana laws at the federal level, Dan Riffle, director of federal policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a statement. Its long past time to end the federal ban, said Michael Collins, policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance, said in a statement. Both describe the introduction of the bill as a first for the Senate. Advocates are riding a wave of success in recent years, with voters in four states Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington approving the legalization of the drug for recreational use.The idea has made significant gains in public opinion as well. In December, Congress for the first time in roughly a decade of trying approved an amendment that bars the Justice Department from using its funds to prevent states from implementing their medical marijuana laws a significant victory for proponents of the practice. Potential Republican presidential candidates Rand, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) have all said they support states rights to legalize pot, though they themselves disagree with the policy. In recent years, several national polls have found majority support for legalizing marijuana. Differences are typically highly split by age the young tend to disproportionately support such policies. Medical marijuana has been approved to varying degrees in 23 states and D.C.", "summary": null}

Massachusetts and California, where Napster co-founder and cancer philanthropist Sean Parker helped fund a campaign to legalize the drug, were among the states passing new recreational marijuana laws. The tide also turned in Florida, North Dakota and Arkansas where similar measures were defeated in the past and in Montana where measures regarding medical marijuana were passed. Before this week, medical marijuana was legal in a little ove rhalf the country or 25 states. The wins come as rigorous scientific evidence is mounting that marijuana or its components may have beneficial medical effects. Earlier this year,GW Pharmaceuticals said that clinical trials show a cannabis-derived drug may be able to reduce seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome, a rare and severe form of epilepsy. Physicians are also increasingly looking to marijuana as an alternative to highly addictive opioids that have led to a crisis in overdoses. This chart, from my colleague Christopher Ingraham , shows just how dramatic the difference in the painkiller prescriptions is in medical-marijuana states vs. non-medical-marijuana states. Here's a closer look at the medical marijuana measures passed Tuesday night: Florida: A similar measure was narrowly defeated two years ago. This time, voters cast their ballots overwhelmingly in favor of a full-scale medical marijuana program. The new amendment states that patients with illnesses of the \"same kind or class as or comparable to\" serious illnesses, such as cancer, HIV, post-traumatic stress disorder, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy would be eligible to access medical marijuana. Some450,000 residents would qualify, according to The News-Press in Fort Myers. The state already had laws on the books that allowed the use of marijuana for the terminally ill and of a cannabis-derived drug for epilepsy. North Dakota: According to the Bismark Tribune , \"The measure will allow people to possess up to 3 ounces of medical marijuana for treatment of up to nearly a dozen medical conditions. Facilities for medical marijuana distribution will be licensed by the state Health Department and operated by nonprofit organizations.\" Montana: The Independent Record in Helena reported that the measure means that \"providers of the drug will not be limited to the number of patients they can serve:\" \"The previous restriction imposed a limit of three, which was sharply opposed by patients and providers in the program.Most medical marijuana patients were left without a registered provider under the restrictions. Since they went into effect, patients have left the program. More than a third of patients registered in September left over the next month 7,785 remained in October, according to the state health department. \"I-182 adds post-traumatic stress disorder to the list of eligible conditions, allows for lab testing for marijuana and orders annual health department inspections of providers.\" Arkansas: The measure allows people who have any of18 qualifying conditions such as cancer, glaucoma, Tourette's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease and hepatitis C to access dispensaries. According to the Associated Press and KTHV , \"some political leaders said they preferred that Arkansas legislators instead allow a version of the drug that is low in THC, which gives marijuana its high.\"", "summary": null}

Records show 78 had been arrested as of April5. That compares with 142 people arrested in 2015, the year that marijuana use but not the sale of marijuana became legal in the city . Arrests for distribution of marijuana also nearly tripled last year from 80 in 2015 to 220 in 2016, according to the data. As of April5, 79 people had been arrested for distribution. The data include arrests by D.C. police and other law enforcement agencies in the city. Watch more! As of Feb. 26, 2015 marijuana was made legal in D.C.sort of. Here are the ins and outs of the complex pot law. In an email, D.C. police spokesman Dustin Sternbeck said the department had \"focused its drug enforcement efforts on illegal sales,\" leading to an increase in arrests for distribution. Legalization has led to more arrests for public consumption, Sternbeck said, even though smoking pot outside is still against the law. Some advocates criticized the increase in arrests, saying they disproportionately affected poor people and minorities. Jonathan Smith, executive director of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, an advocacy group that studied marijuana arrests before legalization, said the number of arrests was \"very troubling.\" \"A rise in marijuana enforcement, especially at a time of historic and dropping levels of crime in the District, suggests a return to failed practices of overpolicing and underserving communities of color,\" Smith said. Adam Eidinger, the head of DCMJ, an advocacy group that lobbied for marijuana legalization in the District, was arrested twice in April after handing out free joints near the Capitol. He said the right to smoke marijuana in the District could only be enjoyed by \"those who own private property,\" whereas renters and those in public housing were left out. \"A lot of it is people not realizing they can't smoke in public,\" he said of the increase in arrests. \"A lot of it is people who have no place else to go.\" Peter Hermann contributed to this report.", "summary": null}

New Frontier Data, a data analytics firm focused on the cannabis industry, forecasts that if legalized on the federal level, the marijuana industry could create an entirely new tax revenue stream for the government, generating millions of dollars in sales tax and payroll deductions. When there are budget deficits and the like, everybody wants to know where is there an additional revenue stream, and one of the most logical places is to go after cannabis and cannabis taxes, said Beau Whitney, a senior economist at New Frontier Data. The analysis shows that if marijuana were fully legal in all 50 states, it would create at least a combined $131.8 billion in in federal tax revenue between 2017 and 2025. That is based on an estimated 15 percent retail sales tax, payroll tax deductions and business tax revenue. The federal government would reap $51.7 billion in sales tax from a legal marijuana market between 2017 and 2025, entirely new revenue for a business that remains illegal -- and unable to be taxed -- federally. The business tax rate for the study was calculated at 35 percent. The corporate tax rate was lowered to 21 percent in a sweeping tax bill President Trump signed last month. If cannabis businesses were legalized tomorrow and taxed as normal businesses with a standard 35 percent tax rate, cannabis businesses would infuse the U.S. economy with an additional $12.6 billion this year, said Giadha Aguirre De Carcer, the CEO of New Frontier. The study also calculates that there would be 782,000 additional jobs nationwide if cannabis were legalized today, a number that would increase to 1.1 million by 2025. That includes workers at all ends of the marijuana supply chain, from farmers to transporters to sellers. The study estimates that about 25 percent of the marijuana market will continue to be illicit, and will shrink if the legal marketplace is not overly taxed or expensive. Consumers want to do things legally in general, but they dont want to do it at too much of a price, Whitney said. If they go to 7-11 to pick up cannabis, theyre willing to pay 10 to 15 percent on top of what they get on the street. Once they get above that, it slows the transition and makes the consumer think twice about making that legal purchase. Marijuana is legal for adult recreational use in eight states. California, the worlds largest market, started its recreational sales on Jan. 1. Twenty-nine states allow the use of medical marijuana. In the three states where adult use has been legal for the longest period of time Colorado, Washington and Oregon there had been a combined total of $1.3 billion in tax receipts, according to the study. The nationwide legalization of marijuana, however, is looking unlikely under the Trump administration. While there has been a bipartisan push in Congress to both legalize marijuana nationally and protect the individual states where it is legal, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has gone after the industry. Last week Sessions made it easier for U.S. Attorneys in places where marijuana is legal to enforce federal law, rescinding Obama-era guidance that discouraged enforcement of federal marijuana law in states that legalized the drug. The decision has been pilloried by the cannabis industry, which argued that Sessions is trying to stop the momentum of a growing business and restart the war on drugs. The decision has been harshly criticized even by some Republicans. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) threatened to hold up the confirmation of Justice Department posts in response to the announcement. Sessions said hes enforcing federal law, simply directing all U.S. Attorneys to use previously established prosecutorial principles that provide them all the necessary tools to disrupt criminal organizations, tackle the growing drug crisis, and thwart violent crime across our country, Sessions said in a statement. Some in the industry believe Sessionss actions could force Congress to step in and regulate the market, or move to legalize marijuana altogether. Okay, now Congress, do something, said Morgan Paxhia, managing director at Poseidon Asset Management, which invests in marijuana businesses. Heres a chance to do something meaningful that could move the industry in a much safer direction. To some, there is no safe direction in which the marijuana industry can move. Kevin Sabet, president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, which opposes marijuana legalization, said doing so would impose significant costs on taxpayers, resulting from workplace losses, car crashes, lost tourism revenue, administrative enforcement, and a multitude of other issues. They include, Sabet said, sales to minors and increased marijuana use. We shouldnt let Big Marijuana fool us into believing their billion-dollar industry will somehow result in a net benefit for the country, Sabet said.", "summary": null}

The share of those opposed, meanwhile, has plunged 20 percentage points, to 32 percent, in the past decade. Legalization is supported by 78 percent of Democrats and 55 percent of Republicans. It has roughly two-thirds support among every racial, gender and educational group in the U.S., according to the survey. The data do show one significant demographic fault line, however: age. Legalization is supported by 63 percent of boomers, 65 percent of Gen Xers, and 76 percent of millennials. But among the silent generation those older than 74 years support is just 35 percent. AD Partisan differences are heavily mediated by age as well. Among the silent generation, for instance, there is a 32-point gap in support between Democrats (53 percent) and Republicans (21 percent). Among millennials, more than 70 percent support legal marijuana, regardless of party affiliation. AD In assessing support for marijuana, surveys have typically posed a simple question : Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal, or should NOT be made legal? For this survey, however, Pew researchers posed a separate question to suss out whether Americans back recreational marijuana, medical marijuana, both or neither. Fifty-nine percent said it should be legal for both medical and recreational purposes, a 10-point increase since fall 2016. Thirty-two percent said it should be legal for medical use only. Just 8 percent said it should not be legal at all, a steep drop from the 15 percent recorded in 2016. AD As with many political issues , the publics preferences on marijuana are well to the left of where the policy currently stands. The plant remains illegal for all purposes under federal law. Recreational marijuana is legal in 11 states plus D.C. , in most cases because of voter-approved ballot initiatives. Most other states have some form of medical marijuana law, although in many cases there are severe restrictions on the conditions for which medical marijuana can be used, or on the types of marijuana that can be used. AD According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , just four states Idaho, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas prohibit marijuana use in all forms. As more and more states have moved forward with their own marijuana liberalization policies in recent years, public support has only grown stronger, Erik Altieri, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said in a statement . At a time when the political divide is larger than ever, the issue of marijuana legalization is one of the few policy issues upon which most Americans agree. AD Legalization foes contend that marijuana use comes with negative health effects. This week, the group Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM) highlighted the results of a study in the journal JAMA Psychiatry showing a half-percentage-point increase in rates of problematic cannabis use among teens in states that have legalized recreational use. AD Legalization efforts are sending the message that marijuana use is safe and state sanctioned, SAM President Kevin Sabet said in a statement . \"No amount of marijuana use is safe for young people and more must be done to halt its normalization. Most of the Democratic presidential candidates support legalizing recreational use in some form or another . But there are notable outliers, among them former vice president Joe Biden, who long supported tough on crime legislation while he was in the U.S. Senate. He opposes legalization but has signaled a preference to reduce criminal penalties for pot use. Billionaire Democratic hopeful Mike Bloomberg recently called marijuana legalization the stupidest thing anyone has ever done. President Trump, meanwhile, has had little to say about marijuana one way or another during his time in office, though he did recently reiterate support for letting states decide their own policies.", "summary": null}

I read another story that found marijuana use in the Seattle-area increased rates of testicular cancer. It seems science is all over the place, but many states are trying to amend their local laws in an effort to legitimize medical marijuana use among people that have medical necessity. So I wonder how our new administration will tackle the issue. Are we going to see national guidelines for proper indication based on real science? Or are we going to end up with the same system we have today, which seems to be an unregulated service with poor checks and balances? Certainly one thing that cannot be tolerated is for the federal government to look the other way. The medical community should have a strong voice, not only in science, but in the way the system will operate, since it is they who will most likely be responsible for any hiccups along the way.

This is despite repeated claims from President Obama and his Department of Justice that they would not devote federal resources to circumventing state medical marijuana laws. \"The law has been hijacked by profiteers who are motivated not by compassion, but by money,\" said Melinda Haag, one of California's U.S. Attorneys, at a DOJ press conference on October 11, 2011. Aaron Sandusky, owner of G3 Holistic , a group of medical marijuana dispensaries in California's Inland Empire, is one such target of the DOJ's crackdown on medical marijuana \"profiteers.\" The DOJ sent him a letter promising to shut down his operations within 14 days. And they followed through. Reason.tv talked to Sandusky, who's long battled the city of Upland's sordid handling of medical marijuana dispensaries, before and after he was raided. \"We all want the same thing,\" said Sandusky. \"We want to see less crime. That's why we have these places.\" Sgt. Glenn Walsh and Agent Mark Brewster, both members of the California Narcotic Officer's Association , believe that the stepped up enforcement from the DOJ is a positive development. \"There's no avenue in the law, whatsoever, to accommodate the sales of marijuana,\" Brewster said. Walsh concurs, arguing that California's Prop 215 and SB 420 allow for the collective cultivation of medical marijuana but do not allow for a single cent to exchange hands during that process. \"If it's my land, and I want to help you cultivate marijuana [on it], I can do that,\" said Walsh. \"You cannot, however, reimburse me for any expenses.\" The prospect of cultivating and distributing a legal product to a large demand base without any money changing hands seems far-fetched to medical marijuana growers and sellers like Sandusky, who himself invested hundreds of thousands of dollars and years of his life in a grower's facility before it was raided and destroyed in early November. \"They seized all of our assets, all of my personal assets,\" said Sandusky. \"I have sixty dollars in my pocket. That's it.\" The DOJ has issued threatening letters to dozens of dispensaries across the state and plans to continue shutting them down one by one.

U.S. Attorney John Walsh issued the ultimatum in letters to 23 dispensaries and landlords he said were in violation of federal and state law, a statement Thursday from the U.S. Justice Department said. The move makes Colorado the latest battleground pitting federal prosecutors against storefront distributors of marijuana in states that have decriminalized marijuana for medical purposes. \"When the voters of Colorado passed the limited medical marijuana amendment in 2000, they could not have anticipated that their vote would be used to justify large marijuana stores located within blocks of our schools,\" Walsh said. He cited a 2011 memo from U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole that allows individual federal prosecutors to \"exercise their discretion to handle marijuana trafficking matters.\" The Colorado move followed an announcement in October by federal prosecutors in California that they were cracking down on medical pot dispensaries they said were fronts for large-scale, for-profit drug trafficking. Last March, federal agents also raided greenhouses and dispensaries in 13 cities in Montana cited by authorities as operating illegally under the guise of that state's medical marijuana law. A month later, U.S. attorneys in Washington state issued a legal opinion threatening to prosecute not only dispensary owners and growers but state officials who would have enforced a proposed state licensing system for medical marijuana. Washington Governor Christine Gregoire cited that warning in her decision to veto a bill to establish a new regulatory system for state-sanctioned suppliers of medicinal cannabis. A total of 16 states and the District of Columbia have enacted some sort of legalized medical-marijuana statutes, according to the National Drug Policy Alliance. But cannabis remains classified as an illegal narcotic under federal law, a point Walsh underscored in his letter to Colorado dispensary operators. \"The dispensary is operating in violation of federal law, and the Department of Justice has the authority to enforce the federal law ... even when such activities may be permitted under state law,\" the letter said. Walsh did not identify any of the letter's recipients, except to say the businesses were located throughout the state. Denver lawyer Robert Corry, who represents clients charged with marijuana offenses, said in recent testimony before the Denver City Council that \"there should be no arbitrary distance limits\" for legal marijuana businesses. \"There is no documented case of any child ever purchasing or obtaining medical marijuana from a dispensary,\" he said. Nevertheless, Walsh said law enforcement will be on the lookout for other violators, and offenders could be subject to asset seizure and property forfeitures. \"Those who do not comply will be subject to potential criminal prosecution and civil enforcement actions,\" Walsh said. \"Because the stores are operating within 1,000 feet of a school, enhanced penalties apply under federal law.\"", "summary": null}

Maybe they were convinced this was necessary to fix the states economic woes. Or maybe they were told public officials would use the currency in place of taxpayer funds to bankroll important public projects. The reason doesnt really matter. The key question is this: would you support the right of California to enact such a provision? My guess is not a chance. However, a very similar ridiculous scenario is playing out right now in the State of Arizona, where a new state law permits the distribution of marijuana for medical purposes. And Judicial Watch has stepped into the battle. Judicial Watch filed an amicus curiae brief in the Court of Appeals of the State of Arizona, District One, in support of Maricopa County and the State of Arizonas lawsuit appealing a December, 4, 2012, Maricopa Superior Court ruling that the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (AMMA) did not conflict with federal drug laws. In its brief, Judicial Watch maintains that the AMMA, which permits the use of marijuana for medical purposes, is a direct violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which makes it unlawful to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense any controlled substance: Federal law is unambiguous in that marijuana is a controlled substance regulated under a comprehensive statutory and regulatory scheme. As such, the production, sale, and use of marijuana, other than as part of a federally authorized research program, is a violation of federal law regardless of any state law permitting such activities even in a limited manner. Further, the Superior Court ruling notwithstanding, the CSA preempts the AMMA under the Supremacy Clause, which makes federal laws supreme, contrary to any state law. Citing the CSA provisions, Judicial Watch maintains: ...where a positive conflict exists between the CSA and a state law such that the two cannot consistently stand together, the CSA shall be construed as evidencing Congressional intent to occupy the field in which the CSA provision operates . And how did this wind up in the courts? In 2010, Arizona voters narrowly approved a ballot measure allowing people with certain debilitating medical conditions to use medical marijuana. Under the law, state health officials can license up to 126 dispensaries in designated areas. In June, 2012, the White Mountain Health Center sued Maricopa County for allegedly stalling approval of its zoning application to prevent it from seeking a state operating license for a dispensary. In December 2004, the Maricopa Superior Court ruled in White Mountains favor. In its amicus brief defending the Maricopa County appeal, Judicial Watch argues: Maricopa County cannot issue a zoning permit for a facility for the cultivation and dispensing of marijuana any more than it could issue a permit to establish a meth lab or a print shop for counterfeit currency. Our federal system does not permit that. This is a clear cut case where federal law trumps state law, regardless of how many voters may wish it werent so. Medical marijuana special interest groups have invested heavily in shaping public perception on this issue, but we cannot allow the rule of law to be subject to the shifting whims of the electorate. If marijuana is to be legalized, the U.S. Constitution requires that it be done by an act of Congress. In the meantime, a state simply cant legalize something that is a felony under federal law. Conflicting marijuana laws create not just uncertainty in the law, but undermine the rule of law that protects our liberty.", "summary": null}

I do remain very concerned with the scope of this approval and the process in general. First, the condition of PTSD is a mental health issue. Granting this approval steps Michigan away from the use of marijuana for disease of the body or chronic pain symptoms of a physical nature, Arwood said in an order dated last Friday. PTSD is considered a mental health condition linked to a terrifying event. Since Michigan voters approved it in 2008, marijuana typically has been used to relieve the side effects of cancer, glaucoma, HIV, hepatitis C and a few other conditions.

Though Sunshine State voters last fall rejected a broad medical marijuana ballot proposal, a more narrow measure ( Senate Bill 1030 ) was signed by Gov. Rick Scott nearly a year ago. The \"Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act of 2014\" allows some nurseries to grow \"low-THC\" pot and distribute to \"qualified patients\" suffering from cancer, seizures and muscle spasms. But for black growers in the state, \"It's a bad thing,\" said Florida Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association President Howard Gunn Jr. Gunn is referencing one line in the law that is creating controversy. It states farmers must have a license to cultivate \"more than 400,000 plants\" and must have operated \"as a registered nursery in [Florida] for at least 30 continuous years.\" According to Gunn, hardly any black farmers meet that criteria. \"There weren't that many black farmers 30 years ago in the nursery business,\" he said. \"We say they weren't there because of the discriminatory practices set by the USDA.\" Gunn is talking about a case called \"Pigford v. Glickman,\" which started in the 1980s -- it led to one of the largest civil rights settlements in history, worth $1.3 billion. The USDA agreed to compensate thousands of black farmers who allegedly suffered racial discrimination from the USDA's farm loan program. Gunn points to that history in explaining why few, if any, black farmers would meet the criteria today to legally grow medical marijuana. \"Because of that, we weren't able to produce as much or be as profitable as [other] farmers,\" he said. \"If we found one [black] farmer growing that many plants, it would be surprising.\" There's an effort afoot in the legislature to address these concerns, but it got off to a rocky start. After an outcry from black farmers opposing the \"unobtainable\" requirement to grow pot, Sen. Oscar Braynon, a black Democrat from Miami, proposed an amendment to a separate bill to get rid of the 30-year, 400,000-plant requirement. The underlying bill -- which would end legal challenges associated with the 2014 version -- was authored by Senate Regulated Industries Chairman Rob Bradley, a Republican who played a major role in passing the 2014 law. Bradley reportedly asked Braynon to withdraw the amendment -- promising he would work on changing the \"discriminatory\" language in the bill. But that plan did not work out. The session ended prematurely, and neither the bill nor the amendment won approval. \"Unfortunately, the bill did not make it across the finish line,\" Bradley told XXX, He said they will work to address the issue when lawmakers return. \"I think [black farmers] have a legitimate issue and it's something that we will certainly continue to try and address when we're back in session next year,\" he said. Meanwhile, the sponsor of the original 2014 bill, state Rep. Matt Caldwell, said he was not aware of the potential effects the requirements would have on black farmers. \"I thought the ones who've been here the longest should be the first in line,\" he told The News Service of Florida . Florida isn't the only state working on changing marijuana laws. Georgia's governor recently signed a bill that will legalize low-THC cannabis oil for certain patients with illnesses. Around the same time, the state of Washington -- where smoking pot is legal -- created a law that implements a voluntary registry of patients and cracks down on illegal pot gardens.", "summary": null}

The same researchers had previously found that marijuana users were at higher risk of cognitive decline and descent into lower social and economic strata, but the new study suggests the same isn't true for physical health. \"The only measures that seemed to indicate any really serious health problem was periodontal disease,\" said senior author Terrie Moffitt, of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. In periodontal disease, the gums around the teeth become inflamed, according to the National Institutes of Health. The gums pull away from the teeth, creating pockets that can become infected. Left untreated, periodontitis can lead to loss of teeth. For the new study, the researchers studied 1,037 people born in New Zealand in 1972 and 1973. Participants were tracked from age 3 to age 38. Overall, about 65 percent reported using marijuana at some point after age 18, according to the results in JAMA Psychiatry. The researchers did not find a link between marijuana use in adulthood and poor physical health for a number of conditions, including lung function, systemic inflammation, metabolic health, blood pressure and body mass index (BMI), which is a measure of weight in relation to height. After adjusting for a number of factors like tobacco use, the researchers did find that marijuana use throughout adulthood was tied to gum disease toward the end of the study period. Moffitt told Reuters Health that the connection between marijuana use and the oral condition is likely explained by people putting lit objects close to their gums. \"Anything you smoke heats up your gums and causes inflammation and inflammation is bad for your teeth,\" she said. For comparison, the researchers also looked at whether tobacco was tied to any poor physical health outcomes. They found it was tied to a number of poor health outcomes like inflammation, gum disease, cholesterol, lung function and blood sugar. Cannabis \"is not a really big public health problem right now whether it causes mental health problems, downward social mobility and physical ailments because not many people are using it compared to tobacco and alcohol,\" said Moffitt. \"If the proportion of people who are likely to use cannabis were to increase, many problems associated with it would naturally increase as well,\" she said.", "summary": null}

The Highway Loss Data Institute, a leading insurance research group, said in study results released Thursday that collision claims in Colorado, Washington, and Oregon went up 2.7 percent in the years since legal recreational marijuana sales began when compared with surrounding states. Legal recreational pot sales in Colorado began in January 2014, followed six months later in Washington, and in October 2015 in Oregon. \"We believe that the data is saying that crash risk has increased in these states and those crash risks are associated with the legalization of marijuana,\" said Matt Moore, senior vice president with the institute, which analyzes insurance data to observe emerging auto-safety trends. Mason Tvert, a marijuana legalization advocate and communications director with the Marijuana Policy Project, questioned the study's comparison of claims in rural states such as Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana with Colorado, Oregon and Washington that have dense population centers and how that affected the study's findings. \"The study raises more questions than it provides answers, and it's an area that would surely receive more study, and deservedly so,\" Tvert said. Researchers accounted for factors such as the number of vehicles on the road in the study and control states, age and gender of drivers, weather and even whether the driver making a claim was employed. Neighboring states with similar fluctuations in claims were used for comparison. Insurance industry groups have been keeping a close watch on claims when auto accidents across the country began to go up in 2013 after more than a decade of steady decline. Insurance companies found several possible factors at play in the spike that included distracted driving through texting or cellphone use, road construction, and an improved economy that has led to leisurely drives and more miles driven, as well as marijuana legalization. \"It would appear, probably not to anyone's surprise, that the use of marijuana contributes to crashes,\" said Kenton Brine, president of the industry group Northwest Insurance Council that represents companies in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. He added: \"It would be difficult to say that marijuana is a definitive factor, lacking a citation, in a significant number of crashes to say that what we're seeing here is a trend.\" The Highway Loss Data Institute said its study examined claims from January 2012 to October 2016. \"The problem here is that it's a pretty new experience,\" said Carole Walker of the Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Association, an industry group that covers Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico. \"This is the first study that has been able to isolate legal pot as one of the factors.\" Eight states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana for adults. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety spokesman Russ Rader adds that alcohol impairment remains one of the biggest concerns on the road. \"While we have proven countermeasures, proven strategies for reducing alcohol impaired driving, there are a lot of unanswered questions about marijuana and driving,\" Rader said. A study released last year by AAA's safety foundation found legal THC limits established by states with legal marijuana have no scientific basis and can result in innocent drivers being convicted, and guilty drivers being released. Moore of the Highway Loss Data Institute said they hope the study's findings will be considered by lawmakers and regulators in states where marijuana legalization is under consideration or recently enacted.", "summary": null}

Those questions are especially important for one group: pregnant women. Marijuana use during pregnancy is becoming more common , despite the lack of clarity about its possible effects. But today (Aug. 27), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released its first-ever guidelines on marijuana use for pregnant and breast-feeding women. The new recommendations are based on an analysis of the existing research on how marijuana affects pregnancy, breast-feeding and childhood development, and they touch on a range of questions that expectant parents might have. [ 7 Ways Pregnant Women Affect Babies ] Here are the most important takeaways from the report. Don't use marijuana, in any form, during pregnancy. The AAP report concludes that completely avoiding marijuana use during pregnancy is best. That's in part because THC , or tetrahydrocannabinol the compound responsible for marijuana's psychoactive effects can cross the placenta. Several long-term studies have found relationships between marijuana use by pregnant women and slightly shorter gestational periods and lower birth weights, according to the report. Other studies looking at newborns have found that babies who were exposed to marijuana in utero had some other irregularities compared with other babies, such as unusual sleep patterns. Ultimately, based on the available evidence, the AAP decided to recommend against the use of marijuana during pregnancy, said Dr. Seth Ammerman, a pediatrics professor at Stanford University and a co-author of the AAP report. Dr. Torri Metz, a high-risk obstetrician at University of Utah Health, who wasn't involved with the report, said this stance from pediatricians falls in line with what experts in other medical specialties, such as obstetrics and gynecology, have concluded. \"This is not a paradigm shift but something we should continue to emphasize,\" Metz told Live Science. Don't use marijuana while breast-feeding. Breast-feeding moms should avoid marijuana use, because THC, along with some other potentially psychoactive compounds in pot, gets into breast milk, Ammerman told Live Science. In fact, a new study published alongside the report in the journal Pediatrics looked at breast milk from 50 women who used marijuana and found THC in 63 percent of the samples up to six days after they reported using the drug. Other cannabinoids, such as cannabidiol (CBD), showed up in just 5 percent of the samples. More on this... The 11 strangest pregnancy trends Blossoming body: 8 odd changes that happen during pregnancy 18 ways pregnancy may change your body forever Because other research found that these compounds could impact fetal development, it's possible that they could also affect a breast-feeding child, the researchers noted. But that specific link hasn't been explored, and breast-feeding is the still recommended option for a child's milk, Ammerman said. \"The goal is to encourage breast-feeding,\" he said, \"but if you're breast-feeding and using marijuana, you should cut down or stop\" marijuana use. There's no research showing that marijuana helps to treat morning sickness. The new report acknowledges that some pregnant women may use marijuana because they've heard that it eases morning sickness. But \"there are no research studies that say marijuana is effective for nausea in pregnancy,\" Metz told Live Science. If nausea during pregnancy is a problem, there are several treatments approved for use , including vitamin B6 and doxylamine, she added. Doctors who treat sexually active women should talk to them about drug use. Accidental pregnancies happen, and if someone is using drugs in the weeks before they know they're pregnant, that could cause problems for a fetus in its most critical stages, Ammerman said. \"One of the hopes of our recommendations is that pediatricians will take a more proactive role in counseling their patients who are sexually active about these issues, because it is really important,\" he said. In addition to discussing these recommendations with patients, doctors should be careful to avoid judging women regarding drug use, Ammerman added. There are still a lot of questions that need be answered. Despite the publication of the guidelines, there's still a lot of research that needs to be done. For example, researchers have worked primarily with marijuana compounds, like THC and CBD, that people hear about most, but there are dozens more that deserve studies, Ammerman said. There's also a lot of room for research on what, if any, complications marijuana can cause for pregnant women themselves, Metz noted. And researching marijuana's impact on child development can also be difficult. It's unethical to give marijuana to pregnant individuals, so researchers mostly rely on data from parents who report using the drug. What's more, researchers have to account for the different ways pot is used, and decipher the dose concentrations, which are changing THC concentrations in marijuana increased from about 4 percent in the 1990s to about 12 percent in 2014. And, of course, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration still classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, which puts up a lot of barriers for researchers, Ammerman said.", "summary": null}
