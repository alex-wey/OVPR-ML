Dodson is speaking publicly about his arrest through Twitter. He tweeted about his arrest Saturday and created the hashtag # HappyCourtDateAntoine. Let me be the first to tell it!!

Williams went from homeless to gainfully employed after video of his radio perfect voice went viral. But as the recovering drug and alcohol addicts past was revealed, the story quickly went from uplifting to something a little sadder in only two weeks. Williams was arrested, but not charged, in January after he and his daughter argued in a Los Angeles hotel. The next day he admitted he wasnt sober on the Dr. Phil show and entered rehab. Now his story is taking another familiar turn: hes currently filming a reality show . Do the viewers who make these average people Internet celebs hold some responsibility for their fates?

Dodson was picked up on a warrant last Friday when he had cut a deal with the city\u2019s police department for voluntary reduction of charges. The arrest, released last week, also came after he resigned from council \u2013 owing him $2,676 in 2014 and $2,464 in 2015.\nWhen 18-year-old Dodson was selected to join the early stages of the D.C. General Assembly, he stayed put, staying on for at least one month \u2013 until he was arrested and detained at DCC and charged with possession of marijuana.\nAs part of his deal with the city, Dodson was placed on a three-year probationary period, and he served jail time on similar charges. In the pre-trial intervention case, he was also charged with possession of the drug by a private individual, which included serving a jail time. According to his arrest report, Dodson claimed to have experienced a problem while in the city, claiming to \u201cphysically get dirtier and jerky.\u201d\nDodson responded, speaking mostly in hushed tones and using a positive characterization of the officer as \u201ca super nice guy.\u201d He maintained that there was no police officer involved but said, \u201cI was told all day they arrested me and I hadn\u2019t even stepped out of the area to test my breath. My owner who\u2019s my personal physician said I would give them the clean-up so we wouldn\u2019t just turn in dirtier guys.\u201d\nAccording to Dodson\u2019s arrest report, no one appears to have been driving an old white Chevy Blazer owned by one of his past congressional campaign campaign supporters.\nDodson will be held on $300 a day, which means he spent about four hours in jail on Thursday, where police originally believed he had alcohol or drug problems. He turned himself in to DCC police station with a $1,500 bond.\nDid you know that before Dodson was arrested for the marijuana deal, he appeared in a video posted online that depicts him smoking a joint.\nIn a Facebook post, Steve Bush, Dodson\u2019s campaign chief, writes:\n\u201cWhen footage was posted this morning using a former volunteer and uploaded to YouTube a user called PoliticalDog.\n\u201cHe showed pictures of dozens of papers, including IPR, signed by a potential candidate.\n\u201cHe says the papers were thrown in a dumpster by the top police department without making any of them appear in public.\n\u201cIt is clear that the video is far from legit. [I asked Jim] Levitt, the beat cop, who\u2019s trained with [offensive images] and is in charge of attracting media attention to his job, why is he allowing the video to go online?\n\u201cFORT LAUDERDALE police played them both. If you are a victim of this before, if you are under the age of 13, you should be automatically charged with a felony for not showing up to court.\u201d\nCo-founder of PoliticalDog.com, the Bush-campaign staffers-turned-victims website, Jordan Zimmerman and Jameel Thomas, reached out to Dodson yesterday to release a statement.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[16785, 1680, 12, 2814, 199, 14283,

Ortenzi"], "publish_date": "06-02-2011", "text": "Are we winning the war on drugs? Nope. While thats not a direct quote, it seems to summarize the conclusions of a high-level commission that aims to rethink global drug policies. In a new report , the group recommends legalization of marijuana and calls for drug policies guided by health care and human rights -- not criminal justice. The groups conclusions are the latest challenge to Americas war on drugs. The way Global Commission on Drug Policy sees things, democracy is threatened by the corruption and violence connected with the drug trade and U.S. efforts arent helping things. The debate is particularly hot in Mexico, where drug cartels selling to the American users have led increasingly brazen attacks on fellow citizens in an attempt to maintain profits and fear. Some already wonder if Mexico is a failed state . Its an awkward time for the war on drugs. While federal officials have maintained their stance -- under both Republican and Democratic administrations -- state governments and voters have been approving new medical marijuana laws that are at odds with federal ones . Even the changing political tides seem to be working against the war on drugs. The rise of Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tx.) and other libertarians like fellow 2012 candidate Gary Johnson reflect a portion of American society that seeks less government intervention in the lives of citizens. Did you catch Ron Pauls take on heroin at the last GOP debate?", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["The controversial Issue: Marijuana is exploding with potent demand.\nOn April 10, People for the Ethical Treatment of Marijuana reported that the U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NDRH) found 88 percent of Americans now use marijuana to treat and treat an ancillary disease: agitation. That\u2019s 18 times more people in the United States now using marijuana than alcohol.\nAnd not just alcohol: By 2009, 6 percent of Americans were considering marijuana use or recreational use. Those figures jumped to 13 percent in 2010. In 2015, as more Americans age (versus teens and adults), marijuana use was more than 25 times the rate among adults.\nWhat if all that being said, does it really matter if Americans believe that law enforcement has acted as it does to crack down on medical marijuana use?\nNo. Mostly because there isn\u2019t any war on drugs. That\u2019s because marijuana is legal in the United States. And that is what has led people to think: That legalizing pot is the wrong thing to do.\nNow, people expect it will get popular, but if they don\u2019t, the federal government could start taking action, whether we want to call it terrorism or criminal activity.\nMcClatchy reports the National League of Cities (NLC) is investigating whether the federal government should regulate marijuana. Like the Washington Metropolitan Area Council, NLC is based in the West: \"The NLC\u2019s aggressive goal is to ensure that pot prohibition continues as long as states have proven it to be legal and safe.\"\nFor its part, however, the DEA distorts the legality of marijuana by saying it is \u201cculturally distinct and is different from marijuana \u2026 Weed is legal for medical, recreational and recreational use.\u201d\nSome skeptical observers \u2013 though they could be wrong \u2013 think that those words mean the Justice Department and FBI should actually investigate the possibility of marijuana being banned in the United States.\nThe DEA: \u201cFederal law enforcement recognizes that making a statement to police about a joint activity in the United States, particularly after a joint trip, is very different from a statement that is made to the public.\u201d\nI\u2019m far from a fan of the federal government\u2019s answer to cancer. They may say this is completely legal, but be otherwise na\u00efve. Would they really tell me that legalizing marijuana would put them in jail? Probably not.\nMarijuana and medicine can both fall under the Federal Marijuana Act of 1986. The act says marijuana should be banned from the possession and use of any adult only in one state. Proponents note the law gets rid of the constitutional amendment to ban it, but still say the purity of pot has been right up until now.\nGroups who support the legalization of marijuana say decriminalizing marijuana should be provided with pot-based tax programs, grants and special exemptions. But if the federal government forces people with addiction problems to violate federal law and spend taxpayer money on treatment, the consequences could be dire.\nSuch efforts have been met with massive political and constitutional resistance.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[465, 8382, 18233, 26, 29110, 319, 30991, 352, 16740, 3513, 14, 199, 2203, 3036, 839, 12, 4381, 330, 263, 9957, 606, 21416,

A judge has rejected a plea deal that would have Nelson plead guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia and pay a $500 fine. The country music legend was arrested in November after six ounces of marijuana were found on his tour bus. The deal was rejected Wednesday by Judge Becky Dean-Walker, who told the AP that Nelson should be charged with misdemeanor marijuana possession. The red-headed stranger could face a year in jail if convicted. This seems like a harsh turn in a case where an attorney said Nelson could get off with a fine if he sang Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain . Sadly, Dean-Walker later said the offer was a joke that got out of hand. This is not the first time Nelson, who has appeared on multiple High Times covers and in the 1998 film Half Baked, has been arrested for marijuana-related crimes. He was sentenced to six months probation for a misdemeanor count of marijuana possession in 2007.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["He may have a deal that will save Willie Nelson\u2019s life.\nIn a deal hammered out between the case\u2019s prosecutors and defense attorneys last week, a plea deal was struck with Willie Nelson, who is still a free man after being granted a drug-related arrest. The sale of marijuana in Colorado, where Willie Nelson was found dead in his ranch outside of Littleton, Colo., became known as the \u201cherd child\u201d because it was banned from interstate commerce for a year. Prosecutors said Willie Nelson paid at least $150,000 for the drug, yet Willie Nelson was back in hiding.\nBut Willie Nelson made a move, and applied for a plea deal, according to The Washington Post\u2019s Dana Loesch. \u201cAlthough he resisted further contact with the authorities, Willie Nelson recommended that prosecutors look at the possibility of getting him to cooperate with the investigation,\u201d Loesch writes. \u201cSpecifically, a deal would have allowed Willie Nelson\u2019s cooperation to be overseen by the Department of Justice\u2019s Special Agent in Charge in Colorado, Gregg Hicks.\u201d\nAlso on Monday, Willie Nelson\u2019s defense attorney Brian Drummond said in a statement that the government, known as \u201cDAPA,\u201d has stopped making \u201ca profit from Mr. Nelson\u2019s brief appearance\u201d in Colorado, meaning Willie Nelson will not be called as a witness in his felony case. Drummond said that even if Willie Nelson is found guilty, his plea deal \u201cdoesn\u2019t solve the crime, but it will allow a low-level individual from Connecticut to gather money off Willie Nelson

Narcotics investigators for the Metropolitan Police on Monday began visiting stores where they said they had previously made undercover buys or learned of sales of synthetic marijuana, said Inspector Brian Bray, commander of narcotics and special investigations. Another three convenience stores are set to receive visits, Bray said. The product is not illegal under District law or under state law in Maryland, although there have been proposals to outlaw it in both places. Virginia recently banned synthetic marijuana. Spice cannot be detected by current urine testing methods and has become popular among military members, parolees and probationers who face random drug checks, said Bray. Eleven midshipmen have been expelled since January from the U.S. Naval Academy for using or possessing Spice in what is described as an ongoing investigation. On March 1, the Drug Enforcement Administration banned five chemicals that are used to treat herbs to make them mimic the effects of marijuana. The DEA is empowered to put a substance temporarily in Schedule I to avoid an imminent threat to public safety and acted, its spokesmen said, after increasing reports from emergency room doctors of convulsions, elevated heart rates and anxiety attacks among other side effects. At the time of the DEA ban, 16 states had outlawed the herbal mix, which often is packaged in foil envelopes and labeled as incense. Bray said it is selling in the District for about $40 a gram. Users in the District could be prosecuted due to the DEAs action, but it likely would be a minor drug case for federal court, said Bray, which is why investigators are focusing on putting stores on formal notice they stand to forfeit business assets for selling and distributing products containing the banned chemicals. In addition to Spice and K2, the fake pot is sold as Wicked X, Bliss, Black Mamba, Bombay Blue, Fake Weed, Genie, Blaze, Dream, Ex-Ses, Spark, Fusion, Dark Knight, Yucatan Fire, Sonic, AK-47, Atomic Orange and Zohai.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["The Bothell police have arrested five suspects at the estate of former Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, who became disillusioned after he went to jail on bank fraud charges in 1998.\nPeter Flint, a fifth suspect arrested in the case, was charged Friday with possession of marijuana.\nPolice say Flint was able to conceal his use of the drug using an ordinary envelope stuffed with $400 in cash. The change of possession can\u2019t be seen by police from that envelope\u2019s photo.\n\u201cIt was at an O.C. address, and he changed it to his own house,\u201d said DC Police spokesman Officer Jason Judd, a spokesman for the precinct that investigates suspicious activity. \u201cThe man noted some political and religious ties and he explained that he didn\u2019t have the goods to be convicted of receiving it.\u201d\nAccording to Judd, Flint was a criminal who moved around from town to town when he moved to Bothell, where he filled in on policy meetings.\nBefore he took charge of DC\u2019s Office of Law Enforcement and Oversight, Flint served as attorney general for the District of Columbia for nine years under the Nixon administration, which included close ties to the Democratic Party and a long grudge-swapping with then-White House Chief of Staff Ben Cardin.\nOn one occasion during his brief time in office, the federal prosecutor assigned to prosecute him alleged that Flint had targeted black homeowners who got into trouble by running afoul of their property-law convictions.\nD.C. law-enforcement investigators began tracking Flint after he filed a petition against himself with the Department of Justice in October 2000.\nJackson Burch, 18, and Melvin Moore, 23, were arrested in March 2004, charged with wire fraud, bank fraud, and mail fraud. They each received a warning letter for turning over a mortgage and other payment information.\n\u201cThey were all just trying to keep it quiet,\u201d Jackson Burch said. \u201cIt was about the case. I know that they were really unhappy with where I was located, and I know the people who stayed in the East Village and saw where I was located.\u201d\nMary Pat Flaherty contributed to this

After Tampa police pulled over the 27-year-olds orange Chevy Camero early Thursday, Dukes tried to eat a small bag of marijuana , as first reported by the Tampa Tribune. Dukes was charged with drug possession, tampering with physical evidence, possession of drug paraphernalia and three counts of driving with a canceled or suspended license. He was not, however, cited for watching Super Troopers one too many times. According to records obtained by the Tribune, Dukes has been arrested dozens of times since 2001, including charges related to domestic violence and failure to pay child support. The Tampa Bay Rays selected Dukes in the third-round of the 2002 draft. He was released by Washington in 2010 after spending two up-and-down seasons with the Nationals. Last February, Dukes began rapping under the name Fly Eli, and in a Tampa Tribune story, said he would sometimes smoke marijuana before Nationals home games. Dukes also said he felt he had been blackballed by baseball after he came forward alleging fellow players were smuggling drugs onto chartered planes and using them in their hotel rooms. Major League Baseball refuted Dukes claims . Dukes, who has six children with four different women, was suspended in each of his first five professional seasons.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["Wearing a wig, wary of the sight of a car on the street, Elijah Dukes was out and about Thursday night when he noticed a car on the median weaving in and out of traffic, according to a police report. Dukes went into a red SUV to check if anyone was in the vehicle and found the driver, 55-year-old Elijah Bradford, smelled of marijuana, he said.\nThen, something happened, said Dukes, who ran into the car, waved off the driver, and drove away. Then two shots were fired. The driver, who has not been identified, shot at the trooper that Dukes said was driving, when he fled on foot, Dukes said.\nThe trooper made a quick pursuit, which went to two blocks north of the intersection with Talen Drive. By that point, a car stopped but all six occupants got out, police said.\nThe chase ended, but didn\u2019t move at all.

Council member . His void-filling has wasted no time. Orange informed his colleagues today that hes proposing an emergency bill that will place limits on the number of medical marijuana facilities that can go in any particular ward. He would like a vote as soon as next Tuesday. Under the draft bill circulated Thursday by Orange, only five marijuana cultivation centers could be permitted in any single ward. As for dispensaries, where medical pot would actually be retailed, Orange aims to limit those to only two per ward. Also, if a ward has five or more cultivation centers, no dispensary could locate there. This is of particular interest to Ward 5, where most marijuana entrepreneurs are looking to open up their facilities as documented by DCist and the Washington Times. Orange represented the ward from 1999 to 2007. Former council member Harry Thomas Jr. had pondered a similar bill late last year, but, as it turned out, he had other matters to attend to . Many Ward 5ers including several who spoke at an Orange-hosted meeting Monday arent too jazzed about the prospect of legalized drug facilities, as theyre already quite annoyed about the concentration of strip clubs and other unsavory businesses in the ward. But theres a reason for that: Zoning restrictions keep many of those businesses from locating elsewhere in the city. Ward 5, with its relative surfeit of industrially zoned land and relative deficit of schools and other facilities that complicate the location of said unsavory businesses, just happens to be the main place these folks can legally go. There is nothing in the Orange bill that would address that problem, meaning the bill could be a de facto cap on the number of medical marijuana facilities above and beyond the caps contemplated in Health Department regulations (10 cultivation centers and five dispensaries). Update, 5:45 p.m..: Orange said hes not stopping with marijuana facilities; hes also aiming to cap the number of strip clubs, topless bars, gentlemens clubs, or adult entertainment establishments in a separate piece of legislation. I promised the Ward 5 leadership I was going to get this done, he said. A West Virginia Avenue NW establishment, Club AKA 55, has declared its intention to feature nude dancing, and Orange says he wants to nip the issue in the bud, as it were. If youre going to have a discussion on the cultivation centers and dispensaries, you might as well have a discussion on strip clubs as well, he said. Regarding the marijuana facilities, Orange said hes hoping his colleagues would see this oversaturation is unfair. For emergency legislation to pass, Orange needs nine votes out of 12. Asked whether he intends to address the zoning restrictions that are most responsible for said oversaturation, Orange said, that may be the product that comes out of this legislation. If its still determined 10 cultivation centers are needed, he said, maybe someone will present legislation to relax zoning regulations. What about Orange himself? Not at this point, he said.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["An Arlington man proposes drastic changes to Washington\u2019s marijuana industry in an effort to boost the Legislature\u2019s lack of progressive policy toward marijuana\u2014and thus influence in the future.\nVeteran Washington marijuana entrepreneur Vincent Orange, who was born in Washington, D.C., and writes extensively about the industry in his new book, Dreams From the Weed, was promoting a a proposal this week to outlaw marijuana dispensaries.\nContrary to Florida and South Carolina\u2019s laws, he\u2019s seeking to amend the Controlled Substances Act to prohibit regulatory restrictions that will create a market. Many dispensaries currently operate under D.C. rules, but Orange says the regulations should be pulled from all state regulations as conditions.\n\u201cWe are trying to create a market where marijuana cannot be sold in D.C.,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are no dispensaries in Washington. It\u2019s impossible for me to see anybody selling marijuana in D.C.\u201d\nFrom the Washington Post\nThe proposed legislation would:\n\u2014 Create a division of general excise taxes to govern the sale of marijuana;\n\u2014 Oppose government-sanctioned dealers;\n\u2014 Crack down on \u201cscientific\u201d dispensaries like Andre\u2019s Drug, which Orange shut down last year;\n\u2014 Create a clear regulation of such stores and clarify that dispensaries that aren\u2019t owned by individuals but licensed by the government won\u2019t be allowed to sell marijuana.\nEach proposal proposes banning existing medical marijuana shops that\u2019s operated by individuals in Washington state. The group led by the lobbyist Wes Rojek, is also pushing for the creation of a state-approved adult pot dispensary that would be strictly regulated.\nSince 2011, there have been a total of 8,853 people and 15,300 marijuana products sold in Washington. Critics have called the government takeover a flop, with activists calling it a \u201cmoral failure\u201d and Democrats calling it a potential gift to criminalization. Critics have even gone so far as to challenge the findings of a study that Texas ranked among the nation\u2019s largest providers of medical marijuana.\nNow, Orange says \u201cnone of us think patients should have to make their own choice\u201d about the path to treatment in such shops. And with dozens of people he says has completed medical marijuana treatment, \u201cI think the best way to look at the expansion is to establish an end to this stupor and preserve as many aspects of the system as possible.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Orange also proposed a bill to expand access to an internet-based framework allowing individuals to file a complaint that marijuana is not growing in the community; he\u2019s also calling for a ban on dispensaries in rural areas of D.C. He also said he favors giving judges greater discretion in determining whether dispensaries aren\u2019t complying with state rules.\nWhat prompted Orange to propose a ban on dispensaries in Washington?\n\u201cSomeone told me it would ruin my business. You go to a dispensary and you say you come from Washington? And they say you come from Texas. I don\u2019t know what hell is going on.\u201d\nIn 2011, he told the Washington Post, \u201cAll of a sudden, as a new client starts meeting with me,\u201d he was asked to post details of their business plans in his email. When reached for comment this week, Orange said the complaint will be dropped. He\u2019s also eager to see how Vail\u2019s drug treatment center works when it\u2019s up and running.\nA News and Observer poll found overwhelming support for legalizing medical marijuana in the District of Columbia, with 73 percent of those surveyed supporting the concept. A majority agreed that the District was the center of its industry, as well as the location of its dispensaries.\nWhat do you think? Should we continue down the federal drug trade as the Mother Jones article does? Sound off in the comments section.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[2026, 30380, 583, 26018, 27070, 2459, 285, 2670, 448, 248, 83, 5728, 2832, 288, 282, 3627, 285, 5751, 263, 20816, 448, 248, 83, 3093, 287,

But before long its going to get much bigger, moving into the electoral arena around the country and forcing itself into national debates in a way it hasnt been before, much as same-sex marriage did over the last few years. Were rapidly approaching the day when no politician with any significant ambitions can avoid having a well-considered position on the issue. Would-be public officials are going to be asked about it with increasing frequency, and it wont be enough to make a Cheech and Chong joketo change the subject. That isnt stopping them from trying, however. When Chris Christie got asked about legalization on his radio show, he said : For the people who are enamored with the idea with the income, the tax revenue from this, go to Colorado and see if you want to live theresee if you want to live in a major city in Colorado where theres head shops popping up on every corner and people flying into your airport just to come and get high. To me, its just not the quality of life we want to have here in the state of New Jersey and theres no tax revenue thats worth that. Officials from the rancid cauldron of sin and misery that is Colorado were quick to respond . From the beauty of the rolling hills of the Eastern Plains to the magnificent landscapes in the mountains and from our smallest rural towns to our largest cities, Colorado offers the greatest quality of life in the nation, said Senator Michael Bennett. A lot of people think Colorado is great place to live, work and play. Plus, we have a pretty awesome quality of life, said a spokesperson for Governor John Hickenlooper. Obviously, those guys must be high. This is something of a preview of the arguments well see as we move toward 2016 and legalization initiatives are on ballots all over the country. Youll notice that Christies argument was pragmatic, not moralistic. He didnt say that people who smoke pot are losers and criminals, or that its an instrument of evil. Instead he talked about the trade-offs between tax revenue and the vitality of urban shopping districts. Opponents of legalization realize that moralistic arguments against marijuana are going to be political losers, what with the fact that a majority of Americans now support legalization , plus the fact that most Americans have used it at some point in their lives . But that doesnt mean Republicans are going to come around to legalization any time soon,a factDemocrats hope will allow them to use ballot initiatives to burst turnout among some of their target constituencies. To be sure, this fall there may end up being only a couple of marijuana initiatives on the ballot. Florida voters will decide on a constitutional amendment providing for medical marijuana, and a full legalization initiative could make it to the ballot in Alaska . Advocates are also trying to put a measure on the ballot in Oregon . But if youre a legalization advocate,you actually shouldnt want to have an initiative on the ballot this year. In state after state, advocates have decided to wait until 2016, when they know more of Democrats and young people will be going to the polls to vote for president, to put the question to the voters. Advocates in California considered mounting a push this year, then put it off until 2016 . That presidential year could also see initiatives in Arizona, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, and Nevada, and possibly other states as well. Theres a good reason for this: Polls show huge divides by age and party on theissue. Recent surveys by the Pew Research Center show that while only 32 percent of Americans over 65 favor legalization, 70 percent of those 18 to 29 favor it. The divide between parties is only slightly smaller, with 63 percent of Democrats favoring legalization compared to 39 percent of Republicans. With half a dozen or more states deciding legalization at the polls in 2016, it will be impossible for any politician to ignore. And after years of fruitful hippie-bashing, Republicans will find themselves increasingly on the defensive. And this issue is only going to get bigger and bigger.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["Marijuana legalization is hitting the ground running in Washington. In passing legislation in the Senate in October, President Obama talked about legalizing marijuana for recreational use, pushing the ban on all but certain exemptions to the medical marijuana law, and widening recreational efforts to create jobs around the country.\nNow marijuana is officially being talked about \u2014 in the same way food is now being talked about \u2014 in Washington as the state of Washington. As WTOP\u2019s Rick Shpigel notes, to fight back against growing marijuana use in Washington, the Obama administration must persuade marijuana opponents that this may not be the goal.\nSo why did marijuana\u2019s critics bring up the issue this week? A scientific study by researchers at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health concludes that alcohol is almost certainly the most harmful contributor to a person\u2019s early development, and they\u2019ve watched the medical marijuana market expand from a small fraction of the dispensary market into a total of 13 percent of the marketplace.\nHowever, there are a couple of reasons why prohibition has been palatable politically in Washington \u2014 small, homegrown entrepreneurs don\u2019t have the same access to the public health authority that the medical marijuana legalization law permits. One reason is the simple fact that medical marijuana is relatively safe, and proponents of legalization are fearful that marijuana\u2019s already threatening the livelihoods of developing countries that are reliant on food imports.\nAnother reason is Washington\u2019s reliance on rice, which has a favorable genetic profile, can make it difficult for farmers to obtain the proper plant plants. \u201cWhile marijuana does have the potential for increased food exports, it will take a while to appreciate the benefits of its potential as an agricultural item,\u201d Shpigel writes. \u201cHowever, if Washington really embraces the medicinal use of marijuana, it is likely to raise the cost of food for farmers.\u201d\nFinally, though Washington\u2019s enforcement of medical marijuana law could go further than simply distributing medical marijuana to minors, the senators' struggle to keep the ban on enforcement appears to be a holding issue for both Democrats and Republicans.\nImage: The State

With recently passed legalization laws going into effect in Colorado , and reports that New York is planning on loosening its marijuana laws, the best we can hope for is that these laws are written in a way that will protect the innocent as much as possible. Soon well be seeing the first reports of crime resulting from the marijuana business the DUIs, problems with underage access, etc. These are already problems associated with alcohol. Without question, we will face more human tragedy and ruined lives as a result of marijuana legalization. Tyler Williams of Blanchester, Ohio, selects marijuana strains to purchase at the 3-D Denver Discrete Dispensary on Jan. 1. Its not good policy to facilitate the opportunity for more inebriated people to wander among us. Legalizing marijuana is just not a good idea. Even my friend Ruth Marcus at XXX, who is not exactly a conservative commentator, said that widespread legalization is a bad idea, particularly because of the known negative impact smoking marijuana can have on adolescents and their development. She cited a 2012 study that found that persistent cannabis use was associated with neuropsychological decline broadly across domains of functioning. Republicans need to be clear on where they stand on this issue.We shouldnt think up reasons to do the wrong thing to try to look hip or appeal to reckless youth. If the Democrats think they have found an issue for 2014, let them be the ones to promise more pot to the population. And spare me the talk about personal freedom being at stake here. You arent more free if you are a pothead and freedom isnt measured by marijuana consumption.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["Is this inevitable, or is the Republican Party past its prime?\nWeeks before the midterm elections, the party that had wised up to the fact that marijuana taxes weren\u2019t a popular issue, cast questions on marijuana legalization policy in a memo sent to top officials. In it, chief tea party strategist Richard Ben-Nelson outlines his concerns, and offers some suggestions.\nOne GOP memo suggested legalizing marijuana would have less of an impact on voter identification efforts, reducing turnout by 4 percentage points, but would not have affected general elections. The memo from Ben-Nelson, provided by Senator Tom Coburn, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, makes no agreement with the GOP. He\u2019s holding a conference of conservative Republicans in Wyoming last week to discuss the issue.\nWe suggest, if you like Republican Party, you don\u2019t want to be alone on this.\nWhen you accept the wisdom of the day, welcome home. Your moms, your dads, and/or your children. Put something on the ballot.\nWhat do you want, a message, a welcome home message? This should represent your beliefs. Who has won this election?\nUgh, why? The American people believed in a \u201cliving constitution\u201d and not Trump. We are told everything is fine (and also overrun, if you disagree) and now we are threatened by the specter of all these governments falling into ruin (or worse, failing). The matter of whether we are required to have reliable records like state and local record keeping can be a great blessing if we are punished harshly for voting against them or that we do not have the decency to pledge allegiance to the freedom that is our Founding Fathers. I do not propose any reformation or replacement (or repeal) of our founding documents (self-government, colonies, etc.).\nThe state of Pennsylvania was whipped for the committee meeting and I don\u2019t believe it was based on a bad idea. I personally have led both parties that I know respect the sovereignty of a state and they have all shown loyalty, respect, and respect to each other. Pa. is the most popular state for all patriots; I have served in national politics. I have learned to love Pennsylvania. Read their patriotic motto and let\u2019s pray that it will inspire other people to follow their advice.\nHire a recruiter. A few pejorative questions here\u2026\nWhy would I hire a recruiter? The difference between a startup and an enterprise is they operate in an alternate universe, the same, you know. It\u2019s the difference between a job interview and a job placement interview. The open-arena job interview is the easiest and quickest way to get up on top of the company. Let them know that they can do that job interview and they will. Furthermore, they will know that they are not hired for every role because they will have to have a degree or whatever. They could do that job interview themselves, and perhaps their offer could be an employee that they were interested in. If it wasn\u2019t, they would be fired, and I don\u2019t expect them to. If it wasn\u2019t, they would not be hired anyway.\nWe can\u2019t call you a sucker. But you\u2019re a designer, a tennis consultant, an editor, and a dominatrix. Right?\nIn no way does your vote count. Insiders have done their jobs, but if you vote for political insurance against the veto, you can get sent out only a military and overseas brigade of members. Turnouts usually go less than 20%. Whatever happened to cheers?\nWe hope you find this amusing, and don\u2019t hesitate to vote for a progressive nominee.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[3793, 429, 13204, 12, 394, 319, 263, 3416, 3616, 1614,

The summary, which Attorney General Kamala Harriss (D) office releases for each proposed ballot measure, says the state would save in the low hundreds of millions of dollars annually on law enforcement costs associated with enforcing marijuana laws. As an added bonus, Harriss office said sales tax revenues could add more cash again, in the low hundreds of millions of dollars annually to the states bottom line. Supporters of the proposed ballot measure would need to collect 504,760 signatures by May 23 to get the initiative formally known by its ballot title, Marijuana Legalization. Initiative Statute on the 2014 ballot. The group backing legalization wont actually be collecting signatures for this version of the bill; the lead sponsor told the San Francisco Chronicle that they had tweaked the initiatives language to allow individuals to grow more marijuana for personal use. A revised version [pdf] of the ballot initiative, dubbed the Marijuana Control, Legalization and Revenue Act of 2014, is scheduled to be reviewed by the attorney generals office by the end of January, the Chronicle reported. Both versions of the measure would legalize the use, growth, cultivation, possession, transportation, storage and sale of marijuana, while creating a commission to regulate and issue business licenses for cultivation and sales. The measure would apply retail sales taxes to marijuana sold for recreational purposes, while allocating that money equally to education, health care, law enforcement and drug abuse programs. It also prevents state and local law enforcement officials from enforcing federal marijuana laws. Some California officials who back marijuana legalization had urged fellow supporters to wait until 2016, when the electorate will be larger, younger and more ethnically diverse, to put a measure on the fall ballot. But the ballot summary is so favorable that strategists think they will be able to pass the measure even in the lower-turnout midterm year. California has been in the vanguard of the pro-marijuana movement. The state was the first in the country to legalize the possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes, back in 1996. In 2010, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) signed legislation decriminalizing possession of an ounce or less. If the ballot measure passes, California would be the third state to legalize marijuana, along with Washington and Colorado, where voters legalized the drug through ballot measures this year.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["With an estimated 2 million people in California making marijuana use, the state could save billions of dollars per year if federal law applied, the state's chief legal officer has said.\nTed Smith told reporters on Monday night that the state will have a zero-tolerance approach toward marijuana use as a result of the legalization of recreational pot, which took effect late last month. Recreational marijuana is legal for adults 18 and older in California.\n\"We have enough land, but not enough stores and sufficient infrastructure to make it a $1 billion an investment in a bunch of warehouses, all of those warehouses,\" Smith said at a symposium hosted by the California Conference of the American Medical Association in San Francisco.\nCalifornia's approach will be reviewed by lawmakers on Wednesday, and likely drafted as part of a $10 billion legislation that would limit the number of locations allowed to sell medical marijuana, create a 501(c)(3) entity to run polling places and tax services and open dispensaries to the public.\nCalifornia voters approved medical marijuana with 91 percent of the vote, legalizing recreational use in June, and used up his budget savings by nine days to encourage doctors and others who treat chronic pain and other chronic ailments to prescribe it.\nCalifornia currently has a fiscal crisis, where revenue from the state's legal pot pot revenue came in late in the fiscal year and the state had less than two months to make up for deficits caused by delayed state-funded pensions, transportation, and housing.\nAccording to Thompson, California's chief medical officer, the issue is too complex for policymakers to solve, the state's rapidly growing population and the medical marijuana industry are both bottom-feeding and traditional business class, and need to be the first in the U.S. to get the benefits.\nAfter dropping an order from a congressional committee in October, Smith joined the Senate Armed Services Committee in April to get the medical marijuana bill passed, delivering the first major passage of a bill which would have allowed doctors to write prescriptions for recreational marijuana.\nGovernment agencies have given the state six months to remove the provisions they want from the statute, according to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate committee.\nSmith, who is under final review as chief medical officer, said medical marijuana has been allowed to work as long as six months, though he acknowledges that the marijuana industry is undergoing some nagging changes in its own control. While he did not specify how that changes could happen, he said that he expected it to take more time than originally planned.\nHe said residents have been asking him about ways to keep their medical marijuana laws more controlled, and that he will then need Congress to pass a standalone bill that is similar to the California version.\n\"Let me tell you, there are only three options for someone making these decisions,\" Smith said. \"Let's deal with those three options: allow patients, allow states to regulate, let's build additional infrastructure that makes it possible for a future legalization of drugs in the state. You can pass other things without derailing and making this move ahead of other things that are on the ballot in California in 2016.\"\nRead the whole story here.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[3153, 282,

So far, most politicians have stuck with support for the status quo, or perhaps the status quo plus various exemptions and loopholes. With 58 percent of all respondents and 65 percent of Democrats favoring legalization, however, theres now a very good chance that a fair number of ambitious Democratic politicians are going to sign up for full legalization as a way to differentiate themselves in Democratic primaries. Matt Yglesias suggests that Hillary Clinton will be among them . I think thats perhaps premature, but maybe not. The way this probably will unfold is that a fair number of candidates will take a legalization position, and some may even try to run hard on it, in 2014 elections and especially Democratic primaries. If its perceived to be successful, then expect Clintons competitors for 2016 to flirt with or perhaps even embrace the position. Only after that or at least, only after its clear that it will happen would I expect Clinton to go along. As a strong front-runner (and assuming shes running), expect Clinton to avoid positions that she perceives as dangerous in a general election, but also expect her to match Democrats who embrace issues that could divide the party. All of that analysis, for Clinton and the rest, is based on an assumption that candidates will react here to electoral incentives rather than their personal views of the issue. I think thats extremely likely in this case; Id be very surprised if more than a handful of candidates for Congress next year have strong personal feelings on this. In that, its probably very different from marriage; while obviously electoral incentives were important, I suspect a lot of politicians cared quite a bit about it on substantive grounds. Its true that there are some libertarian candidates who may try to run on the issue in Republican primaries, but, for the most part, its still going to be a loser there. And remember: just because most Democratic voters support legalization in polls doesnt mean that its a voting issue for them. But, yes, I do think theres a good chance that its going to be an issue Democratic politicians jump on in 2014 and 2016.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["To the Democrats holding the House, it seems like a proposition we already already have: (See) The Democrats take control of the House after the shutdown ends and debate over raising the government.\nWe\u2019re talking about House Speaker John Boehner, who, in advance of Friday\u2019s big vote to reauthorize the 2012 health care law, called the shutdown \u201cthe worst week of his leadership\u201d and warned that the shutdown would \u201cnever end\u201d because he didn\u2019t want to leave the opposition parties in the lurch. On the ground, since we can\u2019t get the word out in a coordinated, ground-breaking way, Boehner said he\u2019d accept the Speaker\u2019s approach.\nBut the Democrats were in a state of \u201cbiologically incoherent confusion,\u201d with no plausible way for Democrats to deal with the shutdown. It was this particular set of \u201ccredentials\u201d that led many to think Republicans, at least initially, would know what it took to make a deal, and believe they could act on that to try to pass it. As one Republican legislator told me in an interview, this isn\u2019t entirely true. From what I\u2019ve seen, the reason that we haven\u2019t seen that clear answer is that Congress was once again utterly unprepared to put aside partisan differences in addressing a very serious crisis.\nYou don\u2019t find many Republicans willing to take on the longer-term issues, such as Medicare and Obamacare. No party that I know is willing to yield on those issues is quite willing to give up on something as grand as protecting Obamacare. But, in fact, there is a high degree of certainty that Republicans can somehow do a deal and win the election. The decision to keep the government shut down is one of the economic things Republicans don\u2019t want to do, but it makes America a bit less popular.\nDemocrats may be winning this battle because of new information about the Democratic Caucus. I know two of them. I spoke to Chuck Rosenberg, the Democrat District of Columbia branch chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus, on Tuesday, and he told me how he, too, was able to agree to the leadership caucus plan without showing up for the vote. And Democratic members shepherded a series of suicide attempts last week. He has been waiting for the next straw.\nRelated: Clashes are keeping Republicans from getting the plan they need to pass. The danger in even sending \u201cemergency\u201d funds to the GOP still seems too great\nThere are several Democrats who are likely to defect and that may not bode well for the GOP chances this fall. Just to give you an idea of how many defections (including likely supporters of the minority party, many of whom are losing their jobs, and even some of them who have backed other minority-party commitments), I\u2019ve got nine Democrats who have shifted away from the leadership caucus caucus. Right now, the rest of the DC delegation has about four to six defections.\nWhat\u2019s more, the Democratic caucus has got a stronger cause: The Democratic Party\u2019s just failed congressional election, which many expect to break soon, and the point of the leadership caucus plan is that they will now be able to push forward on passing legislation to open or potentially reopen the government. And nobody worries that House Republicans will eventually act unilaterally, in order to force a vote on the administration\u2019s controversial fiscal 2014 budget or some legislative maneuver that will supposedly close the budget.\nThat concession could be further sweetened if Democrats face a Christmas Day scramble to resolve some disputes among themselves over issues such as spending. A key question remains over whether the American people are ready for such a deal, and how much help would be available if they would not do the deal they claim they\u2019re rejecting.\nJonathan

Moyer"], "publish_date": "07-11-2017", "text": "Arrests for the public use of marijuana in the District nearly tripled in 2016 and are on track to remain high in 2017, public records show. More than 400 people were arrested in 2016 for public consumption of marijuana, according to D.C. police arrest records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. Records show 78 had been arrested as of April5. That compares with 142 people arrested in 2015, the year that marijuana use but not the sale of marijuana became legal in the city . Arrests for distribution of marijuana also nearly tripled last year from 80 in 2015 to 220 in 2016, according to the data. As of April5, 79 people had been arrested for distribution. The data include arrests by D.C. police and other law enforcement agencies in the city. Watch more! As of Feb. 26, 2015 marijuana was made legal in D.C.sort of. Here are the ins and outs of the complex pot law. In an email, D.C. police spokesman Dustin Sternbeck said the department had \"focused its drug enforcement efforts on illegal sales,\" leading to an increase in arrests for distribution. Legalization has led to more arrests for public consumption, Sternbeck said, even though smoking pot outside is still against the law. Some advocates criticized the increase in arrests, saying they disproportionately affected poor people and minorities. Jonathan Smith, executive director of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, an advocacy group that studied marijuana arrests before legalization, said the number of arrests was \"very troubling.\" \"A rise in marijuana enforcement, especially at a time of historic and dropping levels of crime in the District, suggests a return to failed practices of overpolicing and underserving communities of color,\" Smith said. Adam Eidinger, the head of DCMJ, an advocacy group that lobbied for marijuana legalization in the District, was arrested twice in April after handing out free joints near the Capitol. He said the right to smoke marijuana in the District could only be enjoyed by \"those who own private property,\" whereas renters and those in public housing were left out. \"A lot of it is people not realizing they can't smoke in public,\" he said of the increase in arrests. \"A lot of it is people who have no place else to go.\" Peter Hermann contributed to this report.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["The federal government has been busting social media for marijuana \u2014 in part, the government wants to stop people from committing harm on a street named after Cesar Chavez in a gay day of celebration and legalization.\nThe media industry is fighting back, as experts and citizens are posting videos and pictures of stoned people on social media. A legal clinic at the Metropolitan Medical Center in Washington is processing 3,000 addicts, treating 6,000 addicts a month \u2014 more than twice the population of the District.\nThe D.C. public health department hopes the crackdown will have only one outcome, but its emphasis on the crush of photos and videos sharing the history of the drug and its origin is disappointing.\nAs the D.C. Health Department moves to crack down on social media and marijuana use, individuals are warning about the growing popularity of cannabis in the shadows.\nHere\u2019s how the D.C. Public Health Department compares the number of St. Patrick\u2019s Day and Halloween martinis in D.C.:\nBetween the two days in 2015, there were 7,921 legalized marijuana drinkers \u2014 or 25,437 people \u2014 who were on the streets that same day \u2014 in total, according to the health department. That\u2019s an 8 percent increase compared to 2015, as officials investigated two major marijuana busts: the NYPD\u2019s Route 128 and Anne Arundel Avenue dispensary raided by federal agents.\nSix of the 17,000 people sampled in the two dispensaries that raided by police during Saturday morning raids occurred in DC, according to the health department.\nAnd the portrait of the public, says the D.C. Health Department, also shows the number of cannabis users \u2014 those who caught the drug \u2014 rose sharply between the same period in 2015 and 2016.\n\"And as federal employees become more marijuana savvy and learn about street use and the use of it, so will more people,\" said Alexis M. Koopchuk, an assistant director at the research office at Washington University in St. Louis.\nThe D.C. Public Health Department\u2019s annual marijuana-awareness survey shows nearly 50 percent of respondents said they didn\u2019t believe pot has had enough of popping up on the streets.\nNicollette LeRoux writes for Washingtonian.

Nearly two-thirds of them are in local jails. The report says thatmost of these jailed inmates have not been convicted of any crime: They're sitting in a cell, awaiting a day in court, an appearance that may be months or even years off, because they can't afford to post bail. \"It's been 45 years since the war on drugs was declared, and it hasn't been a success,\" lead author Tess Borden of Human Rights Watch said in an interview.\"Rates of drug use are not down. Drug dependency has not stopped. Every 25 seconds, we're arresting someone for drug use.\" Federal figures on drug arrests and drug use over the past three decades tell the story. Drug-possession arrests skyrocketed, from fewer than 200 arrests for every 100,000 people in1979to more than500 in the mid-2000s. The drug-possession rate has since fallen slightly, according to the FBI, hovering near400 arrests per 100,000 people. Defenders of harsh penalties for drug possession say they are necessary to deter people from using drugs and to protect public health. But despitethe tough-on-crime push that led to the surge in arrests in recent decades , i llicit drug use today is more common among Americans age 12 and olderthan it was in the early 1980s. Federal figures show no correlation between drug-possession arrests and rates of drug useduring that time. But the ACLU and Human Rights Watch report shows thatarrests for drug possession continue to make up a significant chunk of modern-day police work. \"Around the country, police make more arrests for drug possession than for any other crime,\" the report finds, citing FBI data. \"More than one of every nine arrests by state law enforcement is for drug possession, amounting to more than 1.25 million arrests each year.\" In fact, police make more arrests for marijuana possession alone than for all violent crimes combined. The report finds that the laws are enforced unequally, too. Over their lifetimes, black and white Americans use illicit drugs at similar rates, according to federal data. But black adults were more than 2 times as likely to be arrested for drug possession. \"We can't talk about race and policing in this country without talking about the No. 1 arrest offense,\" Borden said. The reportcalls for decriminializing the personal use and possession of drugs, treating it as a public-health matterinstead of a criminal one. \"Rather than promoting health, criminalization can create new barriers to health for thosewho use drugs,\" the report says. \"Criminalization drives drug use underground; it discourages access toemergency medicine, overdose prevention services, and risk-reducing practices such assyringe exchanges.\" The report reinforces its point by noting the lengthy sentences handed down in some states for possession of small amounts of drugs. For example, itsketches the history of Corey J. Ladd, who was arrested for possessing half an ounce of marijuana during a 2011 traffic stop in New Orleans. Because he had convictions for two prior offenses involving the possession of small amounts of hydrocodone and LSD, he was sentenced in 2013 to 17 years in prison as a \"habitual offender.\" He is currentlyappealing the sentence to Louisiana's Supreme Court. \"Corey's story is about the real waste of human lives, let alone taxpayer money, of arrest and incarceration for personal drug use,\" Borden said. \"He could be making money and providing for his family.\" Watch more! How marijuana legalization in Washington, Colorado and Oregon is working out so far. But Ladd's treatment is far from the harshest drug-possession sentence uncovered by ACLU and Human Rights Watch researchers, whoconducted analyses of arrest and incarceration data from Florida, New York and Texas. In Texas, for instance, 116 people are currently serving life sentences on charges of simple drug possession. Seven of those people earned their sentences for possessing quantities of drugs weighing between 1 gram and 4 grams, or less than a typical sugar packet. That's because Texasalso has ahabitual-offender law, allowing prosecutors to seek longer-than-normal sentences for people who have two prior felonies. \"In 2015, more than 78 percent ofpeople sentenced to incarceration for felony drug possession in Texas possessed under agram,\" the report found.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["\u2014Thirty-nine people were arrested at midnight as part of a federal federal investigation into how marijuana use is fueled by street-level activity and the real impacts of use are seen in day-to-day neighborhoods.\nA spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration says in an email that these arrests reflect the \"limited number of individuals\" committing marijuana-related crimes as of Sept. 18, but some are likely less visible. The agency\u2019s Florida division has also arrested more marijuana offenders than any other agency for any crime since 2009. The violations follow a national crackdown on marijuana under President Barack Obama.\nThe following are the most-reported traffic offenses involving marijuana:\n71 incidents involving marijuana possession, followed by 143 incidents involving drugs (21), and 24 incidents involving drugs (13), according to an ad released by the DEA on Wednesday. Thirty-nine percent of the violations, which included possession and related arrests, involved drug dealing. Marijuana possession also rose 18 percent last year from the previous year.\nSpikes in violent crime among young people 12 years of age and older, for example, were higher in 2014, compared with 2013. These crimes are seen as linked to potential violence \u2013 since it has been widely reported that the criminal groups are more likely to use marijuana as a part of drug sales and robberies, among other things.\nTwo of the most commonly reported cases \u2013 driving while under the influence (AOCS), the most common crime characterized by people convicted of OWI \u2013 involved marijuana or other drugs for sale or reselling.\nSecurity and income levels were similar in Ohio, Florida, and Nevada, and less common in Missouri, Maryland, and New Hampshire, among other states.\nAccording to the new data, city-level marijuana arrests in larger cities accounted for 30 percent of marijuana arrests in the country.\nMore than 8 million marijuana smokers around the country are thought to have completed or experienced at least one OWI in 2015. Nearly 80 percent of the cases involve marijuana use.\nMarijuana possession is not the only drug involved in the arrests, as about 85 percent of their crimes involve marijuana possession. Eighty percent of those marijuana-related arrests involved heroin possession.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[961, 38857, 13, 30889, 662, 548, 5170, 380, 15897, 356, 637, 287, 258, 2718, 2718, 3646, 657,

More than 70 of them were growing in a hydroponic system of his own design. Sometimes, he'd stay in his barn for 16 hours straight, perfecting his technique. That night, he left around 8 o'clock to head home. The moon was waning, down to a sliver, which left the sky as dark as the ridges that lined it. As he pulled away, the lights from his late-model Kia swept across his childhood hollow and his parents' trailer, which stood just up the road from the barn. He turned onto West Virginia Route 65. Crossing Mingo County, he passed the Delbarton Mine, where he had worked on and off for 14 years before his back gave out. Though Johnsie was built like a linebacker, falling once from a coal truck and twice from end loaders had taken a toll. At 36, his disks were a mess, and sciatica sometimes shot pain to his knees. Still, he managed to lift the buckets that held his plants; friends sometimes helped. In another part of the barn, they had set up a man cave with a big-screen TV and girlie posters. When they weren't transplanting and trimming, they played video games and discussed their passion for cultivating pot. None of them had studied marijuana like Johnsie, but they all loved growing, seeing it not just as a hobby or a way to make a buck but as an act of compassion. \"Mostly the people that bought were older men and women, Vietnam veterans and people that's been hurt,\" Johnsie told me. \"I mean, to hear them say, 'You know, ever since I started smoking your pot, I ain't touched a pain pill ...\" He trailed off, shaking his head, but it was clear what he meant. In a state with one of the nation's highest rates of overdose deaths, most of them opioid-related, it felt good to give people an alternative, one that even the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said this year has never caused an overdose fatality. Minutes after leaving the barn, Johnsie parked in the light of his own trailer, a newly remodeled 14-by-60 that he shared with his wife, Faye, and 14-year-old daughter Bethany. His phone rang. It was a neighbor from Rutherford Branch Road, where the barn stood. Cops were there, asking about him. Inside, Johnsie dialed his mother. Two officers, she told him, were standing in her living room. She handed the phone to one of them. Though he didn't have a search warrant for the barn, the officer said he could get one, according to Johnsie. \"But,\" he said, \"I think it would be better if you come and talk to me first.\" (This account is based largely on Johnsie's recollection. Neither arresting officer was permitted to be interviewed for this story, but it is consistent with a description of Johnsie's case in the 2015 West Virginia State Police Annual Report.) Johnsie hung up. He'd placed cameras around his building and vented it out the back, but people were packed tight into that narrow hollow. It was only a matter of time before someone figured out what was inside. Turning to his wife, he said, \"Look, I'm going up there, and I'm going to jail.\" With Skoal tobacco, his one chemical vice, pressed tightly against his cheek, Johnsie drove back to Rutherford Branch Road, where officers met him outside. \"It's like this. I got your dad. I got a lot of pot on him,\" Senior Trooper D.L. Contos told him. This was no surprise. Sam Gooslin had smoked pot for decades, and half of Johnsie's pot went to him. His dad relied on it to ease pain from lung cancer, a new ailment layered atop others diabetes, a stroke, four heart attacks and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \"He's a Vietnam veteran,\" Johnsie recalls Contos saying. \"I respect that. I don't want to see a veteran go to jail. If you make me go get a search warrant, I'm taking you to jail, and I'm gonna get your dad on felony conspiracy charges because he's taking the blame on what's going on up there.\" Johnsie had only one option. He crossed the road and unlocked the barn, opening a series of doors to release a flood of light. The officers paused. One said he had busted hundreds of marijuana operations and had never seen anything like this. For the next two hours, Johnsie walked the officers through his process. He explained the role of the lights and hydroponics; why he placed three plants in a bucket, not one; how he used gibberellic acid to push the plants at just the right time. At the end, he recalls Contos telling him they had to seize his plants, but, referring to Johnsie's equipment and supplies, he said, \"I'm not going to take it away. One day, this might be legal.\" The first time Johnsie planted pot, he was 14. He stole a single seed from his father and buried it. \"I didn't know what I was doing,\" he recalls. \"I was just a kid being a kid.\" That seed barely grew, but it did take root in a sense. Years later, while still working in the mines, he began reading about marijuana cultivation. Though he'd already learned that he couldn't smoke it himself (every attempt made his heart race and left him paranoid), the science behind the plant, the act of nurturing it, enthralled him. After he stopped working at the mine about five years ago, and after his father gave him the barn, Johnsie tried growing marijuana again, this time treating the exercise more as a science experiment. He was actually the third generation of Gooslins with a passion for pot. His father didn't grow it but smoked it constantly. His grandfather, a former Kentucky constable, was just the opposite. He never used marijuana but sold it to supplement his retirement income. At one time this sort of thing wasn't uncommon, says 1st Sgt. Michael Smith, who heads West Virginia's drug-eradication efforts: \"It was generally local individuals that would go back in the woods and, similar to the image of old-time moonshiners, they would get them a clandestine location and take care of their crops. Families would grow marijuana. ... They would hand it down.\" Reliable estimates of the size of the marijuana market in West Virginia are hard to come by. According to the group NORML, which advocates for marijuana legalization, pot has been West Virginia's most valuable cash crop for the past 20 years. Lately, however, marijuana has been overshadowed by opioids, which are devastating parts of coal country. In Mingo County, where Johnsie lives, a single pharmacy pumped out 9 million hydrocodone pills over just two years, according to a 2016 investigation by the Charleston Gazette-Mail. That was enough for every man, woman and child in the area to have 350 of them. Hydrocodone was part of a new generation of opioids that pharmaceutical companies introduced in the United States in the past two decades and heavily marketed to doctors as posing minimal risk for addiction. That, of course, wasn't true, and as government officials cracked down on prescription opioids, they became prohibitively expensive, pushing addicts in West Virginia and elsewhere toward illegal substitutes, including heroin, which ran about a third the price. The Mountain State is now ground zero of one of the worst drug crises in our nation's history. In 2015, 725 people died of overdoses in the state, the highest rate per capita in the country. Last year, that figure grew another 15 percent, reaching a staggering 844 deaths. That averages to one West Virginian dying from an overdose every 11 hours. Eighty-six percent of the state's overdose deaths in 2016 involved an opioid. While there are no easy answers to the opioid crisis, a growing body of research suggests that legalizing marijuana could help. More than a dozen states with legal medical marijuana have recorded significant drops in overdose deaths from other drugs, including heroin, according to a 2014 study in JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association. A 2015 pilot study by Yasmin Hurd at the Behavioral Health System's Addiction Institute at Mount Sinai found that cannabidiol, a compound in marijuana, minimized cravings for opioids, making it easier for participants to stop using them. And unlike methadone, an opioid that is used in drug treatment to minimize cravings for opioids, cannabidiol was not addictive. Hurd is pursuing further research but argues that legislators must address this epidemic now. \"You can't wait for all the ducks to be lined up,\" she says. \"You sometimes have to make bold steps.\" Attempts to decriminalize marijuana in West Virginia date to at least 2010, but for years no bills made it out of committee. As of 2015, the year of Johnsie's arrest, stalwarts in the Republican-dominated legislature still could not bring themselves to legalize marijuana for medical use. But younger lawmakers would not let the issue go. One of the leading proponents of loosening restrictions on marijuana in West Virginia is Democratic state Del. Mike Pushkin, who represents parts of Charleston and its surrounding areas. Pushkin is an unconventional pol a cabdriver and folk musician who has spoken about his own struggles with addiction. He once told the Charleston Gazette-Mail how he spent 11 years living from crisis to crisis. \"I'm sure there were times that my mother would have thought it more likely she would be attending my funeral than she would be attending my swearing-in at the Capitol,\" he said. It took a spiritual awakening to get his addiction under control. To stay sober, he told me, he volunteers at detox facilities and talks to addicts in area jails. This experience informs his policy positions. He's sure West Virginia can't arrest its way out of this drug crisis. And he has pushed his colleagues to consider marijuana in a new light. \"While marijuana is described as a gateway drug, that's not proven,\" he says. \"What is proven is that a lot of people who are prescribed painkillers get hooked on heroin.\" Though he spent only 14 hours in jail, Johnsie returned to his trailer a different man . The police did not confiscate his equipment, but he was still charged with a felony for cultivating marijuana. That, combined with his back problems, made it nearly impossible to find work. He was not allowed to leave the state, which meant he could not move to a place where he could grow marijuana legally. With his $1,000 or so in monthly pot sales gone and Faye making just $9 an hour as a cashier at a gas station, cash was dwindling fast. They had begun receiving $129 in food stamps, but that didn't help much. \"Three people eats more than that in a week,\" Faye says. Johnsie's lawyer, Wesley Kent Varney, chose for strategic reasons not to rush his case, instead engaging in a slow, courteous dialogue with Mingo County Prosecuting Attorney Teresa Maynard. He thought he could get Johnsie off on a technicality, in part because the pot the police confiscated later disappeared. Varney told me police also found no marijuana \"bricked up\" for shipping, no scales, not even any large sums of money making this a low-priority case for Maynard. Even when she proposed a plea bargain that would have put Johnsie under home arrest, Varney sat on the option, hoping to get a better deal. (Maynard declined to comment for this story.) That approach kept Johnsie free, but his family's losses started adding up. Debt collectors began calling. Both their cars were repossessed. \"Before I was arrested,\" he says, \"we was both pushing an 800 credit score. Wasn't nothing we couldn't buy on credit at any given time. Now, I think mine is 500 and hers is like 470. Pitiful.\" About a year after his arrest, the bank came for their trailer the nicest place Johnsie had ever lived, and just about the only home his teen daughter could remember. The family got 24 hours' notice. Their sole option was moving to the battered trailer next door that had passed hands in Faye's family over and over until it was empty and rusting with bent underpinnings and insulation peeking through holes in the walls. It was raining that day, and no one could help. That left Johnsie, with his bad back, and Faye to carry their belongings through the mud. They hauled all they could but ended up leaving a lot. \"We worked ourselves to death,\" Faye recalls, \"and we just couldn't do it.\" She didn't go outside when the repo guys came. Instead, she watched through a leaky aluminum-framed window as they hitched up their trailer and hauled it off. Her living-room furniture, desk and bed frame were still inside. After that, Johnsie rarely left home. During the days, while his daughter was at school and Faye at work, he alternated between his computer chair, where he read articles about marijuana reform elsewhere (Massachusetts, Maine, California and Nevada would all legalize adult use of the drug in 2016), and the window. There, he'd chew tobacco and stare at bare soil, where their old home had rested. In May 2016, Pushkin introduced a bill in the West Virginia House of Delegates to let adults grow, use and possess a limited quantity of marijuana, provided that they paid a one-time fee of $500. That month, he told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that he didn't have high hopes for its passage. He was right: It wasn't even debated in a committee. But it did spark media attention and prompted an eye-opening brief from the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, which showed that a marijuana tax could be a boon for the state, generating as much as $194 million annually if the drug were legal for adult use. That would be enough to eliminate West Virginia's projected deficit and create a $183million surplus, a dramatic improvement in a place that's been slashing everything from higher education to Medicaid as it tries to stay afloat. Indeed, Pushkin's argument for marijuana legalization had a strong economic component. \"They're not having the types of budget issues in Colorado that we're having here,\" he told the Charleston Gazette-Mail. In Colorado, where pot is now fully legalized, the industry created 18,000 full-time jobs in 2015 alone. New Frontier Data, a financial consultancy in Washington, estimates that by 2020 the marijuana industry will create upward of a quarter of a million jobs in the United States, more than manufacturing is expected to create. It's hard to imagine anywhere that could use these jobs more than West Virginia. Since the 1980s, both coal and manufacturing in the Mountain State have been in a steep decline. As these industries have dried up, so have others that rely on them such as freight rail, which has cut jobs by the thousands and begun pulling up tracks. Smart leaders would have diversified their economy decades ago, but that didn't happen here. \"We've been relying on the extraction industries for far too long,\" Pushkin told me, noting that West Virginia is not just experiencing a budget crisis or even a drug crisis. The state's population is shrinking; many who stay are depressed by their prospects and taking poor care of themselves. A National Bureau of Economic Research paper published in February found a positive correlation between a county's unemployment rate and its opioid overdose death rate. And a link between unemployment and drug use was also confirmed by a meta-analysis of 28 studies, including 10 done in the United States, that appeared in the June issue of the International Journal of Drug Policy . Diabetes rates exceed 150 percent of the U.S. average in some parts of West Virginia, and obesity is just as severe. Pushkin sees the opioid crisis as more of a symptom of the underlying economic one. \"When you see countries that are based on one industry, those are mainly Third World countries,\" he says. \"We're really like a Third World country inside the United States.\" In his rundown trailer, with no end to his legal limbo in sight, Johnsie soon faced another setback. His father had begun having seizures. They became so routine that Johnsie was not alarmed when, on June 24, 2016, he got a call informing him that Sam Gooslin was bound for the hospital. But this time, when Johnsie arrived and said his name at the nurse's station, a chaplain approached. \"I knew then it wasn't good,\" he recalls. No one was sure, but they thought his father might have had another stroke. This one was just too big. As the two-year anniversary of his arrest approached, Johnsie found himself without his father, unable to pursue his passion and flat broke. He grew more reclusive and stopped having people over because he was ashamed of where he lived. \"Gained 20 pounds,\" he says. \"Just sitting and waiting on death.\" But just as he began to feel like he was fighting a losing battle, Maynard, who had lost her reelection bid, decided to step down early. The incoming county prosecuting attorney, Jonathan Jewell, was inheriting a mound of cases. Varney was quick to point out a case that the new prosecutor could settle fast one where the defendant, Johnsie, had kept his nose clean for two years while on bond. This was a gift to Jewell, who scheduled a hearing for Jan. 31. (Jewell did not respond to requests for comment.) For several nights prior, Johnsie lay awake, thinking about all that had happened. Beside his sleeping wife, with his daughter just a thin, splintered wall away, he tried to picture their future. He couldn't work coal, not with his back like it was, or even stand at a register all day. That and growing marijuana was about all he was qualified to do. He could probably get a job at a legal growhouse in California. He knew somebody who knew somebody who owned one. But Johnsie was a good-old-boy conservative. He supported Trump and pokes fun at liberals. He loves guns and four-wheeling. \"I just don't know if I can handle California,\" he once told me. Plus, how could he uproot Bethany while she was doing so well in school taking advanced placement classes? He wouldn't dare do anything to upset her future. The morning of his hearing, Johnsie rose bleary-eyed and, with Faye, drove under a bright winter sky. The 20-minute ride was quiet. They didn't know what to expect at the Mingo County Courthouse. Inside, things moved fast. Each lawyer said a few words, and within 10 minutes, West Virginia Circuit Court Judge Miki J. Thompson dismissed the case without prejudice. For the first time in two years, Johnsie was truly free. He and Faye drove back to their side of the county and, at the gas station where she worked, celebrated with ice cream cones. Meanwhile in Charleston, Pushkin and like-minded lawmakers saw an opening to try again for legalization. In late 2016, both gubernatorial candidates had publicly supported legalizing medical marijuana. And some of their colleagues were showing a new openness to it. In February, he backed legislation focusing on medical marijuana. While it met with familiar opposition in the House of Delegates, a similar bill wove through the state Senate with bipartisan support. This forced the House speaker and other old-guard Republicans to soften their stance. The bill not only made it out of committee, it was debated on the House floor and an amended version passed. The bill permits patients to use pot derivatives, such as oils and pills, but prohibits smoking the plant or growing it at home. Just 10 growers will be authorized statewide, and the price to play will be steep a $50,000 registration fee. On April 19, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice (D) signed it into law. Many lawmakers who voted for the bill were reacting to public pressure and media scrutiny. And although the law passed, there is no certainty that the trend toward loosening restrictions on marijuana will continue. \"Close to half the people who voted for that [legislation] are against medical cannabis,\" Pushkin told me, \"but we got something on the books. I do believe we can fix it.\" A bill he introduced to tax medical marijuana is in committee. Beyond that, Pushkin admits, he is still figuring out what to do next. Johnsie doesn't like coffee. Rather than order anything at the coffee shop where he and I are meeting Pushkin on a Friday in May, he waits at an empty table, nervous and fidgeting. I get hot tea, and we talk about how unlikely this sit-down is. With his background, Johnsie never imagined he'd talk to a man who could help undo laws that ruined his life. But when I told Pushkin about Johnsie weeks before and asked if they could meet, the delegate said yes. Coming off an 11-hour shift of cab driving, one that took him clear to Ohio and back, Pushkin walks in while wiping rainwater from his shirt. Both men wear jeans. Pushkin's jeans have a hole over the left pocket. Johnsie's are paired with a button-down for the occasion. Though neither looks their part a West Virginia delegate and a former pot grower they somehow appear to belong at the same table. With a handshake and a nod, they begin a slow discourse on the new marijuana law. Johnsie may have found a financial backer, a Michigan businessman who visits Mingo County's ATV trail a few times a year, but breaking into legal marijuana production would be much easier if the fee were lower. He references a provision that's popular in other states, one that assigns \"caregivers\" to patients. These licensed professionals help people get and use their marijuana. They can even grow it for them. By his own admission, Pushkin doesn't know a lot about the provision, but he's always looking for new ideas. \"I wouldn't mind going back and trying to get that in,\" he later tells me, showing the kind of openness that defines his vision for West Virginia. Pushkin still sees tremendous potential in his home state. Charleston, for instance, has the kind of \"cultural capital\" that attracts newer industries prewar buildings galore, gritty warehouses begging to become lofts, and indie businesses that include a sprawling bookstore-cafe-gallery and a new art-house cinema. In many ways, it resembles Pittsburgh or Asheville, N.C., before those cities became hipster meccas, and Pushkin looks to those places as models. Legalizing recreational use of marijuana could be another asset, a way to boost tourism and retain young people. \"I want to fight to make it the kind of state friends want to move back to,\" he later says. \"I want to help make this a cool place again.\" The scruffy delegate pauses to sip his coffee, and Johnsie fiddles with his phone. Quiet passes between them until Johnsie begins to talk about his passion for marijuana. \"I'd fall asleep at night studying,\" he says, \"with the laptop still on.\" He describes the intricacies of growing, his hydroponic technique, how he kept his plants budding. Pushkin looks down. When he first learned about Johnsie, he said, \"I'm sorry that this prohibition has turned somebody who was just trying to help their father into a criminal.\" Sitting across from this man who lost everything, who had been stripped of his home and livelihood, who is no longer permitted to pursue his passion, Pushkin grips his mug. \"This is the kind of story that needs to be told in the statehouse,\" he says and shakes his head. The two talk a few minutes more until Pushkin's coffee is gone. He stands up and though many politicians wouldn't have even entertained a conversation with a former marijuana grower he extends his hand. \"I'm going to give you my number,\" he says, looking Johnsie in the eye. \"Call anytime you need help.\" After they part, Johnsie and I go for pizza; then he drives an hour in the rain, back to Mingo County, where he and Faye have been keeping their expenses low. She has saved just enough to buy a used car. He now drives a 17-year-old truck inherited from an uncle and spends his days making low-cost improvements to his trailer. While hanging drywall one day to cover torn wallpaper and exposed wires, he deliberates on his future. He still hates the idea of moving to another state. West Virginia gets ahold of you, he once told me, and won't let go. Maybe he can get one of those 10 marijuana-farm licenses. Maybe the legislature will make it easier for regular people to take part in this new industry. He's not sure how exactly, but he's determined to grow his \"babies\" again. He beams at the thought. \"Hook the water and electricity up, and I'd have seeds in the cups tonight,\" he muses and spits chewing tobacco into an empty bottle. \"I'm ready to go anytime, when the law says you can do it.\"", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["Yes, coal country is drying up and coal miners are dying. But how is that to be done?\nIf coal is so important in American medicine, what\u2019s going to happen to it? To the coal habit and societal losses caused by climate change, the answer is different: air pollution has gone from one of the more ecologically important factors affecting medicine to the next. What\u2019s driving the coal addiction? The Earth has long been burning coal for fuel because coal is more dirt than air and water and because the coal that gives power to the engine can no longer be manufactured to replenish it.\nA diesel engine travels on gasoline. A coal combustion engine travels on gasoline. So-called \u201cclean coal\u201d is neither renewable nor natural. It only burns coal, a dirty fuel, for power. There\u2019s no clean coal that remains.\nOil subsidies made much of the dirty, dirty-burning side of the coal industry. In 1976, the U.S. Department of Energy invested heavily in a coal-fired power plant in Mississippi. From 1984 to 1986, annual federal subsidies totaled $30 billion. The program also dumped coal at the American petroleum-oil refinery.\nIn 1985, officials from the Chicago-based Center for American Progress (CAP) convened a conference in Washington, D.C., where CAP had its own coal-fired power plant. The Obama administration also set an eight-year pilot program for 2050-sourced coal-fired power plants, and Administrator of CAP Ronald Parkinson said that coal would get \u201cmeaningful coverage\u201d if the program ended.\nThe clean coal program was around 10 years old but the climate change connection is growing \u2014 the Navy said it had spent two years trying to spark new coal plants in parts of the country. By 2025, the majority of U.S. coal-fired power plants will turn brown. Half the country doesn\u2019t even have a coal plant, according to CAP\u2019s data. That means coal will be burning right next to fossil fuels and harming U.S. natural resources, fossil-fuel companies charge.\nThis grand bargain seems doomed. Coal industries aren\u2019t just flipping dead coal plants. In the case of coal, human misery is inescapable. The destruction of coal plants is not just caused by pollution from air pollution, but also because they cause tragedies as well. In December 2015, a natural gas leak at Exxon Valdez deep in Alaska destroyed up to 3,000 birds and small mammals and prompted environmental law enforcement to set up a wildlife and animal protection task force to find out if it was because of human activity. Unlike a natural disaster, there is very little risk of lung disease or skin cancer because coal plants and air pollution cause far fewer deaths.\nMayors of coal states have announced the creation of a petition drive. It encourages everyone to lobby Congress to end fossil fuel subsidies and to create a federal task force on coal. It has also created a new chief, Joel Ryan of the Appalachian Regional Commission. He said coal is responsible for 20 percent of carbon pollution.\nThis isn\u2019t the end of coal in America. In fact, millions of jobs could be created if coal stations shut down. And in other coal-producing states, no one knows what\u2019s happening. The companies that create jobs say coal-fired plants are making paychecks from the nation\u2019s oil and gas reserves, a demographic a long-term pension fund with a guaranteed income stream to fund.\nThe actual work of planning this federal coal program might be daunting, but taking the lead requires plenty of smart people.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[5298, 12, 5656, 1500, 319, 29622, 511,

The Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) lobbies to eliminate punishments for marijuana use but is not involved in growing or distributing the drug an important distinction for federally regulated banks and other institutions that do business with such advocacy groups. Nick Field, the MPP's chief operating officer, said a PNC Bank representative told him in May that the organization's accounts would be permanently closed July7 because an audit of the accounts revealed that the organization received funding from marijuana businesses that handle the plant directly. \"They told me it is too risky. The bank can't assume the risk,\" Field said. Although marijuana businesses are legal in some states, many banks will not provide services to sellers or growers because the drug is banned at the federal level. But policy and advocacy organizations such as the MPP have been spared. A bank's severing ties with an organization that accepts donations from such businesses signals a new level of concern in the banking industry. PNC Bank declined to discuss its relationship with the MPP, but a spokeswoman said that \"as a federally regulated financial institution, PNC complies with all applicable federal laws and regulations.\" The bank has held the MPP's accounts since the organization was formed in 1995. Some advocacy groups say the abrupt closing of the MPP's accounts is an unpleasant side effect of growing uncertainty about protections for the marijuana industry in states that have legalized it. The industry enjoys loose protection via a combination of legislative amendments and memos from the Justice Department that effectively allow states to operate medical and recreational marijuana businesses without federal interference. But many advocates worry that the Trump administration is changing course to enforce federal laws and dismantle key protections for the expanding industry. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is a longtime opponent of marijuana legalization. During a Senate drug hearing in April 2016, Sessions then a Republican senator from Alabama said, \"We need grown-ups in charge in Washington to say marijuana is not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized, it ought not to be minimized, that it's in fact a very real danger.\" When asked during his confirmation hearing in January whether he would enforce federal drug laws as attorney general, Sessions replied, \"I won't commit to never enforcing federal law.\" The Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment. Last week , Sessions wrote to congressional leaders asking for the ability to prosecute medical-marijuana dispensaries. Sessions implored members of Congress to reconsider a rule enacted in 2014 to prevent the Justice Department from using federal funds to block state laws that legalize medical-marijuana cultivation and use. The sale of recreational marijuana, in contrast, is loosely protected by the 2013 \"Cole memo.\" The memo, issued by Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole during the Obama administration, instructs state law enforcement agencies not to use their resources to prosecute the authorized sale of marijuana in states where it is legal. The vice president for regulatory compliance at the American Bankers Association says these protections are not enough reassurance for financial institutions. Banks are subject to federal regulation to prevent fraud, money laundering or breaches of privacy. \"Because marijuana is illegal under federal law, banks accepting any money associated with its sale could be investigated for money laundering,\" said Rob Rowe, the ABA executive, adding that many banks do not make a distinction between advocacy organizations and businesses that sell or grow marijuana. But Field's organization, the MPP, and many other advocacy groups, such as NORML, say banks' concerns are overblown. The Justice Department has never investigated a bank for offering accounts to state-legal marijuana businesses. In addition, Field said, advocacy organizations are legal entities that are subject to strict scrutiny by the IRS. \"We are a registered 501(c)(3) and (c)(4). We have yearly audits. We are compliant with the IRS,\" he said. \"It doesn't get any clearer than that.\" Field said the MPP is still seeking a new bank. John Hudak, an expert on marijuana policy and governance at the Brookings Institution, suspects that the MPP's difficulty in finding another bank reflects banks' fears that Sessions intends to roll back protections for the industry and enforce the federal Controlled Substances Act. \"It's no secret,\" Hudak said. \"It's a situation that is creating an increasingly uncertain policy environment.\" Amid the uncertainty, Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) introduced a bill to ensure protections for banks providing \"financial services to cannabis-related legitimate businesses.\" The Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act, introduced in April, has 44 congressional co-sponsors. The first provision of the bill would prevent federal regulators from terminating banks' federal deposit and share insurance \"solely because the depository institution provides or has provided financial services to a cannabis-related legitimate business.\" Many marijuana advocacy organizations hope the bill will pass, offering the industry the banking security it seeks. \"It's one thing to take a position about making marijuana legal,\" said Mason Tvert, the MPP's communications director. \"It's something different to say these businesses should be able to be bank legitimately.\" Marijuana advocacy groups point to public opinion as an indication of the industry's legitimacy. Last year, 60percent of Americans surveyed by Gallup thought marijuana should be legal. Justin Strekal, policy director at D.C.-based NORML, said the attorney general is fighting a losing battle against legalization. Strekal is optimistic that organizations such as the MPP, as well as marijuana businesses, will not face the setbacks they have dealt with in past. But he cautioned that things could become worse before they improve. \"This is the death rattle of prohibition,\" Strekal said. \"While we are confident in the end that we will win, it does not mean that [Sessions] isn't going to do as much damage as he can to the industry between now and when he is no longer in power.\"", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["The bankers behind the Alexandria, Va., marijuana business have begun using shaky financial information to help them save money, according to a former employee who can\u2019t remember using it.\nMichael Scafidi, who worked for Bank of America for nine years, found that PNC Bank, the bank he worked for since 1989, lost nearly two-thirds of its pot assets and was forced to raise $152 million to sell it.\nIt is unclear how many company accounts Scafidi has made personal, though he said it could be anywhere from \u201c50 to 100.\u201d He\u2019s not suggesting that any banks would act as a \u201cdrug dealer\u201d if they had access to the public records of industry leaders such as PNC.\nWhile the source of Scafidi\u2019s knowledge was so poorly communicated that Bank of America authorities wouldn\u2019t find him, Scafidi said that until his dismissal, he has talked to people at PNC about the need to make itself clear to taxpayers that its business is no safer than what it claims to be.\n\u201cI was the \u2018drug dealer\u2019 of the criminal underworld,\u201d Scafidi said. \u201cI made $1 million to $3 million a year and sometimes I was caught.\u201d\nScafidi said he\u2019s learned from the government and authorities that in \u201cbank business life\u201d affairs there is a need to make way for a smooth transition.\n\u201cWe get our money taxed, we\u2019re paid by law,\u201d Scafidi said. \u201cWe had to go to an administrator and ask for them to be armed and tough. This will help.\u201d\nTravis Glatz is a White House spokesman and former principal of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a group formed to head an administration review of how banks fail and how to \u201chelp people get their lives back on track.\u201d\nHe described Scafidi and his former staffers as \u201cwealthy private citizens who understand this is important,\u201d and that the bank did \u201chis [Scafidi\u2019s] business.\u201d\n\u201cThey knew their customers better than anybody else at Bank of America, and they lost a big chunk of their customers,\u201d Glatz said. \u201cWe cannot let this happen again.\u201d\nScafidi said the bank would work with prosecutors to figure out what\u2019s happening with the assets in its accounts. A file of BofA documents shows the bank has spent $65 million on legal, financial and inventory investigations that deal with the continuing issue of PNC.\nScafidi said PNC\u2019s filings show the bank has also accumulated enough money to cover the bank\u2019s debt obligations.\nIn the filing, he said Bank of America owes him $204 million in debt.\nScafidi, who claims he worked for Bank of America when he was a banking executive, said Bank of America should have referred him for unemployment benefits and put him on paid leave while under review by regulators. A bank executive would also be recommended to do so if they could identify links between PNC and the company, Scafidi said.\n\u201cI understand that the potential for problem at Bank of America is grave,\u201d Scafidi said. \u201cBut while I admit it must be said, I do not know for sure that Bank of America has gotten another person convicted of a crime.\u201d\nWashington Post\n"],

The legal recreational use of marijuana in Canada is set to start Oct. 17. (Cole Burston/Bloomberg News) David Moscrop is a Canadian political commentator. The march of moral progress is slow. Typically,it is routinely punctuated by halts and detours and backward treks. So, when the Canadian government legalized cannabis last month setting Oct. 17 as the day the Victorian criminalization of the recreational use of the substance will end it was no surprise that it failed to address the matter of what to do with those who possess criminal records for minor possession convictions. Instead, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale have said they will consider pardons, known in Canada as record suspensions, after the law comes into effect. They are essentially asking those struggling with criminal records to stew in their own anxiety and stigma a little longer, preserving the issue for the Liberal Party as a horse it can ride toward the fall 2019 election. Forgiveness should have been part of the legislative package from Day One. But since it is impossible to go back in time to correct this wrong, the best the government can do is promise pardons immediately and move on to getting the thing done. Not everyone agrees. If you are the sort who is prone to reaching for the life preserver when the water gets choppy, you might be inclined to cry, But what of law and order? Those convicted broke the law. Nevermind that as a personal and public health risk, alcohol, prescription drugs and cheeseburgers are causing far greater damage. The paternalist prohibition on the use of cannabis has always reflected a state more concerned with empty moralizing (Wont someone please think of the children?) led by timorous politicians who opted to tread a well-worn path rather than cut a new and righteous one of their own. As a result, Canadians have had their lives destroyed because they happened to be unlucky enough to be caught by an officer who felt like enforcing the law that day. Not only was the law foolish; it was inconsistently applied, which means it was also unjust. Arrests, charges and convictions for minor cannabis possession have been appliedarbitrarily and leniently to white and wealthy Canadians. The same cannot be said for poor and black and indigenous peoples, who have been disproportionately affected by prohibitionist drug laws and who still carry with them the criminal records and difficulty finding work to prove it. In an investigative report this spring, Vice News and University of Toronto criminologists Akwasi Owusu-Bempah and Alex Luscombe studied six Canadian cities (Regina, Halifax, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver and Ottawa) and found that the application of the law was vigorously prejudiced. For instance, in Ottawa, the nations sleepy capital, black residents made up 22 percent of the citys cannabis arrests in 2015 despite representing 6 percent of its population. In Vancouver, a pot-friendly town, indigenous Vancouverites accounted for 17 percent of charges despite being just 2.5 percent of the population. The numbers are similar across the country. Mass pardons for small-time cannabis convictions would be the first and easiest step toward correcting some of the injustices rooted in Canadas historically regressive drug policies. They would clear the names of offenders, thereby helping them find their way back into the workforce, easing their travel across borders, and sparing them the cost of the process (more than $600 in Canadian currency about $455 in U.S. money just to apply for grace) and the long wait to begin it (five years after the sentence is complete). The way that legalization is proceeding is Kafkaesque. As the cannabis market opens wide in Canada, among the first through the gate to stake their claim and chase their fortune have been former politicians, lawyers, officers of the law and others in positions of authority. That is especially perverse considering that so many are stuck waiting for pardons and left out of the market. The just and decent and practical thing for Canada to do is to get on with pardons for those convicted of minor cannabis possession. Spare the moralizing. Spare the hand-wringing. Spare the suburban community pandering. Spare the temporizing that conveniently leads up to and perhaps into the next election. Get the job done, and get it done now so that those who have unjustly borne the unreasonable burden of these convictions and criminal records can move on with their lives while the country does the same.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["The legalization of marijuana in Washington state seems poised to wipe out all but one Colorado-based school district, a special school board, and dozens of other cases of pot confiscation by government officers. Will the very existence of this strange law be ended by a combination of common sense and a fear of the police?\nAs it is, many people like Warren Potter, a professor of sociology at Le Moyne College, disagree.\n\u201cThis is the golden age of legalized drugs. But this is not the golden age of the confiscation of marijuana,\u201d Potter said.\nPotter, like many others, agrees that it will open a Pandora\u2019s box of guilt for people who don\u2019t realize there\u2019s a growing cost in doing so. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the loss of legal weed is worth it, and I don\u2019t believe we need it,\u201d Potter said. \u201cWe need \u2014 as an individual and as an organization \u2014 a person who wants to take advantage of a loophole for a criminal use of marijuana.\u201d\nPotter wants all adults to be eligible for immediate legalization. Yet Colorado and Washington state have already passed emergency legislation making millions of dollars in tax payments to parents whose children have been convicted of drug charges. In America, unlimited tax payments are routinely offered to qualifying parents without proof. Which brings us to Christopher Cox, the ACLU\u2019s Washington assistant director.\nWhat does this act do? It opens the door to mass pardons. These are not laws to be hastily hand-held. Cox says the state is discriminating against people who want to put on marijuana vests.\nThe state is already putting money in the pockets of law enforcement for cracking down on pot \u201cpossession,\u201d not guns. It has already tried to get people caught smoking the drug for school medical marijuana \u2013it will be even harder if the consequences of marijuana being sold as medical marijuana continue to emerge as such. Currently, no one\u2019s immune to the consequences of marijuana possession: it\u2019s protected against a fine (probably $10,000) or court date.\nCox claims this is a \u201cmassive\u201d shift away from the existing prohibitions. The executive order, he notes, is merely about plain enforcement of existing laws. \u201cWe look at it from a first-hand and direct perspective that marijuana is legal and it makes sense to take specific enforcement actions when most people think they are taking advantage of a loophole.\u201d\nCox proposes no more laws governing \u201cpopulist\u201d use of marijuana, just targeted enforcement actions that prevent marijuana from being sold only in public places. Colorado is currently working on similar legislation in Washington state, but cities now have entirely different types of marijuana consumption restrictions. Cox suggests there\u2019s now a good chance Americans are putting sanctions on their peers who are buying \u201cpounds of marijuana\u201d (this is defined as a single-use, \u201cnon-marijuana\u201d product), and \u201cpromoting it to legal users.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, Cox argues, the legislation will establish a separate \u201cpolicy\u201d where it can be enforced. The criminalizing of pot research makes it harder for marijuana businesses to grow and manufacture marijuana in an manner that the legal business is able to purchase. Many legal enterprises are already trying to find a loophole in the law, but at very low cost to them. Cox says businesses will have little interest in the black market.\n\u201cMany illegals want to start the criminal business,\u201d Cox says. \u201cThere are real rational reasons why the government is trying to make it illegal for illegals to start a business but too often these are on narrow grounds: they want to be eligible for tax benefits. They want to make money from selling pot.\u201d\nThat leaves Cox to fend off a call to enter criminal forfeiture. He proposes a prosecutorial system where a judge can prosecute what he calls criminalized behavior \u2013 the companies that may have directly supplied drugs to suspected felons. He also suggests things like stopping medical marijuana for patients who have been marijuana patients, establishing an informed consent system for the drug, and registering medical marijuana patients under the age of 18.\nMore and more states are coming forward to give families the freedom to decide on the long-term health of marijuana. I bet the writers of Money in the Corner won\u2019t care if they get prosecuted for marijuana use. But the ignorance of those who are already addicted and already benefiting should be addressed before legalization makes legal use.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[465, 23051, 287, 5728, 288, 2670, 1182,

Frey is pictured speaking at an American Legion news conference in Washington on Thursday. Photo by Lucas Carter/The American Legion Joshua James Frey is clear: Without medical marijuana I would be dead. This Marine Corps veteran is a two-time Purple Heart awardee. He is among the former warfighters, led by the American Legion, who are on the frontlines of the fight for a sensible, federal medical marijuana policy. They are pushing a reluctant Uncle Sam to catch up with overwhelming public opinion that favors allowing cannabis for medical use. We covered the Legions Capitol Hill press conference on Thursday with Frey, other veterans and a bipartisan group from Congress. Veterans, among the most respected citizens, are a potent force in the effort to move the federal government from a backward, anti-marijuana stance that resembles the 1936 melodramatic film propaganda of Reefer Madness more than todays reality of widespread medical cannabis use. Now, we hear the stories of two veterans who use medical marijuana and one who didnt, but whose mother believes would be alive if he did. In powerful, emotional statements at the news conference, they all complained about the dangers of the drug cocktails prescribed by doctors who are prohibited from even discussing the marijuana that has proven far more beneficial for the two vets. Their stories differ starkly from a presidential commission on drug addiction report this month that said there is a lack of sophisticated outcome data on dose, potency, and abuse potential for marijuana. Lets start with Frey, a Melbourne, Fla., combat veteran of the Third Battalion, First Marine Regiment. Medical marijuana saved me, he told the Federal Insider. I feel like I did before the war (in Iraq) mentally and know this could help not just the veterans struggling, but it could help anyone struggling with addiction and PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder). Its time we all stand as one voice and truly move forward withreal hard-lined research and move forward with real compassionate care. Frey was wounded twice in 2004, once in November by a rocket-propelled grenade . Less than a month later, shortly before Christmas, he was shot in the right shoulder, shattering it and detaching his right bicep. He spent two years at the Naval Medical Center San Diego, also known as Balboa Hospital, had six blood transfusions and 22 operations. Ive been real quiet about my medical marijuana use, he said at the news conference. If it wasnt for medical marijuana, I wouldnt be here today. I wouldnt have kids today. I wouldnt have a beautiful wife Ive been married to for 13 years now. He resents the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) saying you are doing something bad. We need to stop the madness. We need to get this stuff on the books. It could help a lot of vets. Boone Cutler is an Army veteran who spent two years in Walter Reed Army Medical Center recovering from combat injuries suffered in Baghdad. Host of the Tipping Point show on KNEWS, 107.3 FM in Reno, Nev., he has been diagnosed with early-onset Parkinsons disease, related to his wartime blast injury. He authored the Spartan Pledge, the veterans commitment against suicide, and is a national spokesman for the Warfighter Rights Movement on PTSD issues. Boone Cutler, a medically retired Army veteran, describes the moment he contemplated suicide, blaming the prescription drugs for losing my self-preservation instinct. Photo by Lucas Carter/The American Legion During his two years at Walter Reed, I was given just about every chemical cocktail you can imagine. When people look at that cocktail they want to know two things. One, why am I still alive and two, why isnt somebody in prison, because it was that dangerous. At a low point, he grabbed my gun and put it to my head, blaming the prescription drugs for losing my self-preservation instinct. He turned to marijuana to help him sleep. My story is not one of Cheech and Chong, he said, sunglasses perched just above his eyes. It wasnt a good time when I started using cannabis. It was simply a way to survive. When he tried marijuana he slept for five hours. At that time, he said, I hadnt slept for five hours in five years. Janos Johnny Lutz isnt here to tell his story, so his mother did. She told a sad tale of depression and prescription drug complicit suicide. He saw combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, where 14 of his colleagues died during Operation Khanjar in Helmand Province in 2009. It is our hope that the story of my son, who was lost because of prescribed pharmaceuticals will open your hearts and minds to research, Janine Lutz said before an emotional pause, to research cannabis, the most safe and effective treatment for our veterans today. She started the LCpl Janos V Lutz Live to Tell Foundation in Davie, Fla., in support of military and first responders. Janine Lutz, CEO of the LCpl Janos V Lutz Live to Tell Foundation, talks about the suicide of her son, who overdosed on drugs that doctors prescribed. Photo by Lucas Carter/The American Legion Her son was diagnosed with severe PTSD and brain injury. The two dozen drugs he was prescribed included Klonopin, which he took in June 2010. Within a week, Johnny attempted suicide, said Lutz. Her son was saved, and Do not give Mr. Lutz Klonopin was noted on his hospital chart. But the veteran was not told that, and he continued to believe that he wanted to take his own life by his own free will, his mother said, not knowing that it was the medication that was messing with his mind. Three months later he was given the drug again, only to be followed by another unsuccessful suicide attempt. This scenario repeated in 2013, but this time her son was successful in his suicide by overdosing on the drugs doctors prescribed. I think my son would be here today, Lutz said, if medical marijuana had been available. But its not for veterans at VA facilities. Almost two-thirds of the general population , however, live in the 29 states and the District where doctors can recommend it. At the VA, medical professionals are not allowed to even discuss marijuana therapy. Many veterans, some using medical cannabis from other sources, have asked VA doctors such as Katherine Mitchell in Phoenix about it. I was not officially allowed to discuss the subject, she said. Whether the establishment wants to recognize it or not, Mitchell added, because marijuana use has moved into the mainstream,health-care providers have an ethical obligation to help our patients understand the potential positive and negative impacts marijuana could have on their health. Instead, she and other VA medical professionals must act like medical marijuana doesnt exist.

The current federal stance is to \u201cregulate marijuana as controlled by medical professionals,\u201d but Congress has remained silent, which the coalition says represents the federal government\u2019s \u201cblindness\u201d to veterans.\n\u201cWe are \u2018supportive\u2019 of the pot legalization effort among service members,\u201d said Cox. \u201cWe hope that bipartisan support will be forthcoming in the coming months to create what may be a watered-down legislation on marijuana, including a recent bipartisan move to Congress to prohibit federal legislation that creates harmful effects on veterans.\u201d\nIt was the third-largest combat-ready advocacy council in the U.S. It contains eight national organizations, including the American Forces Press Service and the Veterans Coalition for Financial Education.\nThe coalition has gone on the record saying that veterans should not be given easy access to medical marijuana.\nIn a 2014 letter to the ATF and the DEA, veterans\u2019 advocates said the alternative to using medical marijuana is \u201ca convoluted and opaque process\u201d that makes them dependent on government resources and medical marijuana for their PTSD and other symptoms, preventing access to it for their veterans.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a veteran\u2019s group, it\u2019s high time you get involved. Someone needs to stand up for our American brothers and sisters in the military and stand up for what we are, and deserve,\u201d a veterans\u2019 group said in an official statement.\nAt the conference, veterans took to the table to speak about the importance of using marijuana for their own mental health needs, their safety and their families.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like pot, you are unsafe, mentally defective, fragile, addicted or not ready for your safety,\u201d said Juan Vargas, a Vietnam veteran who recently served and now lives in Virginia.\n\u201cMarijuana has the potential to help in your one of a kind psychological, behavioral, neurological, and physical disorders, and any future medications that can be used to manage those conditions,\u201d Vargas said.\nMonsignor Joel Briggs, a military veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said that around some 10 percent of veterans who join the military will use medical marijuana for PTSD, and so will veterans. The statement, which you can read by clicking here, provides guidelines for those seeking approval.\n\u201cIf you think pot could help alleviate the many psychological and emotional problems associated with using it, we will encourage you to support it,\u201d Briggs wrote to the ATF in response to a letter.\n\u201cShould the marijuana become a drug that not only harms your self-esteem, but also can produce side effects in some cases, many veterans who are committed to serving and may not feel comfortable using it will be asked to provide a benefit statement,\u201d the organization said in a 2015 letter.\nOnly one known-patient group in Washington has agreed to consider going to federally assisted medical marijuana \u2014 the Washington-based OHA, which distributes medical marijuana to military service members, according to an OHA news release in October.\nUnder Washington\u2019s prohibition, veteran groups have not had access to federally assisted medical marijuana, including the thousands of patients we collect every year, to answer questions about their medical options. But at last count, there were 72 Americans, including 50 from the VA Medical Center.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[2783, 18894, 690, 911, 327, 3806, 282, 7953, 19549, 1029, 5087, 3316, 5728, 288, 263,

Blood"], "publish_date": "09-11-2018", "text": "Nearly 20 percent of the marijuana and marijuana products tested in California for potency and purity have failed, according to state data provided to The Associated Press. (Chris Carlson/Associated Press) LOS ANGELES Nearly 20 percent of marijuana products in California have failed tests for potency and purity since the state started requiring the checks on July 1, a failure rate some in the industry say has more to do with unrealistic standards and technical glitches than protecting consumer safety. The testing has been especially tough on cannabis-infused cookies, candies and tinctures: About one-third have been blocked from store shelves. In much smaller numbers, testing companies licensed by the state are finding unacceptable levels of pesticides, solvents and bacteria, including E. coli and salmonella, according to data provided to The Associated Press by the state Bureau of Cannabis Control. In the first two months, nearly 11,000 samples were tested and almost 2,000 failed. In some cases, the product must be destroyed. But many involve labeling issues that can be corrected. For example, a marijuana bud thats tested to show a different potency than whats on the label can be relabeled and sold with the right specification. To the state, the strict testing program is largely doing what it was designed to do: identify marijuana buds, concentrates, munchies and other products that are in some way tainted and unsuitable for eating or smoking. Mandatory statewide testing is a new thing and its going to take some time for everything to run smoothly, but on the whole were pleased with how things are progressing, Bureau of Cannabis Control spokesman Alex Traverso said. But as regulators consider recasting rules governing the nations largest legal pot economy, they are facing pressure to revamp testing requirements that are being alternately described as going too far, not far enough, or an overly costly burden. The California Growers Association, an industry group, is among those concerned the state is forcing growers and manufacturers to hit too tiny a target when gauging levels of THC, the psychoactive chemical that causes marijuanas high. Rules require the THC concentration come within 10 percent of what is advertised on a product label. Company executives say some products are being rejected after landing outside the margin by tiny amounts. The California Cannabis Manufacturers Association, another industry group, is pushing for changes that include allowing companies to challenge lab testing results. Even if the lab admits it made an error, there is no way to change those results, said Bryce Berryessa, an association board member who is CEO of TreeHouse dispensary in Santa Cruz County and president of La Vida Verde, which produces infused cookies. Labs are not perfect. Mistakes get made, he said. At a state hearing last month, the Santa Ana-based testing company Cannalysis urged regulators to broaden their rules to include a test used in food and pharmaceutical industries that company officials say can detect a large number of potentially harmful species of mold and yeast not currently covered in state guidelines. The company has seen examples where mold was on cannabis but the sample passed state tests. Swetha Kaul, the companys chief scientific officer who sits on the board of the California Cannabis Industry Association, said in an interview the state needs to create a bigger net to catch things. By limiting its required review to a few mold species the state is essentially creating a loophole where every other species can get by, she said. California began broad legal sales on Jan. 1 and gave companies six months to sell off stockpiles of marijuana, oils and edibles produced without strict testing requirements. The rules require all cannabis products to clear a range of tests at labs before reaching consumers, from ensuring THC is distributed evenly in chocolate bars to making sure buds have not been contaminated by fuzzy blankets of mold. From July 1 through Aug. 29, labs tested 10,695 product batches and 1,904 were rejected, a failure rate of about 18 percent. Claims on the label, such as THC content, accounted for 65 percent of the failures, or 1,279 tests. This is how the rule works: If a bottled juice drink said on the label it was 25 percent apple juice, testers would have to find that the concentration in the juice was within 10 percent of that mark, plus or minus. Its the same with cannabis. Next in line: About 400 batches were flagged for unacceptable levels of pesticides. Impurities such as bacteria and mold caused 114 rejections. Ninety percent of the buds that were tested were sent on to shops, suggesting a mostly clean market for legal growers. The rejection rate was double that for concentrates: 20 percent of oils and waxes tested didnt make the cut. In a statement, the California Department of Public Health said it had not received any verified reports of illness resulting from consumption of a cannabis product attributed to mold or bacteria, although three complaints were submitted anonymously and were unverifiable. The debate over testing isnt just about lab procedures or allowable levels of pesticides. It all comes with a cost, which companies say is straining their budgets. Testing is currently costly, slow, and inconsistent, the growers association told the state in a recent letter. Testing for a small, outdoor marijuana farm can typically run $5,000 to $10,000 in California. There have been similar complaints in pot-friendly Colorado, where cultivators are dealing with new, required pesticide tests. While California now has the nations largest legal market, a huge black market still exists. Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore spotlighted the risk of buying on the illegal market last week, warning consumers that the price from money saved can be their life. He said unlicensed shops are known to lace their pot with Fentanyl and other narcotics.

Almost one-third of people who were smokers went on to graduate high school, and 21 percent to obtain a job.\n\u201cThe survey numbers make it very clear that adults who smoke marijuana regularly can treat their conditions better,\u201d Health & Human Services Commissioner Mary McCarthy said in a statement. \u201cWe are committed to providing people with the healthcare benefits, security, and choice they need to live a healthier life.\u201d\nBut the average age of pot smokers is 29, which is why the Department of Health says the survey has resulted in significant differences across state lines. And under state law, lower smokers will have their penalties reduced accordingly.\n\u201cAs we encourage healthier growing and smoking habits in our communities, no one should underestimate the importance of getting control of their own smoke when it comes to managing their health,\u201d state Department of Health Supervisor Ben Doust said in a statement. \u201cGoing ahead, we are committed to holding proponents of marijuana to account for why they chose to allow their most careless use on the streets of the state.\u201d\nThe findings mark the first time an advisory from Health & Human Services has cited cannabis as a health risk, and an update on existing recommendations and recommendations is required if new smoking regulations are not adopted this year.\nThe state Health Care Agency found marijuana use is associated with 12 different health conditions, including COPD, asthma, and acute respiratory syndrome. The highest risk is chronic lung disease, and the lowest is chronic smoke-related headache and seizures. For the seventh time in 14 years, the Agency found marijuana use is likely to be an addiction.\nThe first six months of 2016 tested for marijuana-related deaths among Californians as California legalized legal cannabis for medical use in a referendum.\nHealth & Human Services created a commission to study the amount of cannabis use among people in California and conduct a review of whether the state\u2019s restrictions on such use will affect how people get access to pot. The agency said it plans to have six months to do that before reaching a final decision.\nThe report comes a month after California Gov. Jerry Brown approved the legalization of medical marijuana for patients 16 and older. The measure expands the state\u2019s medical marijuana program, and also expands state-run growth and distribution of pot shops.\nCalifornia voters legalized medical marijuana in 2012, and the state has seen a resurgence in use in recent years. Over the past decade, more than 550,000 people have accessed medical marijuana through licensed dispensaries, according to the Marijuana Policy Project.\nDespite the findings, critics say the Health & Human Services report is a political stunt designed to stop support for marijuana legalization from shifting to other issues.\n\u201cThese results are especially disappointing when we first asked the surveyors to consider changing how they characterize marijuana use,\u201d Susan Friedman, president of the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a statement. \u201cThe rising costs for many patients should not be underestimated.\u201d\n"], "gensraw_article": [[19620, 1212, 1548, 509, 7524, 5728, 390, 853, 5717, 13456, 330, 2613, 4370, 12, 10727, 4891, 12, 291, 1729, 585, 24025, 12, 1865, 285,

(David Zalubowski/AP) Four decades after Virginia legalized medical marijuana in a pioneering but ultimately unworkable way, dozens of companies are vying for the states permission to grow cannabis and make a medicinal oil out of the otherwise outlawed weed. Under emergency legislation passed early this year, Virginia will grant up to five permits to produce cannabidiol (CBD) oil or THC-A oil. Stripped of most of the plants THC, the chemical compound that triggers the intoxicating reaction in the nervous system, the oils have been touted as treatments for severe seizures and other maladies. Virginia is taking a restrictive approach as it once again cracks open the door to medical marijuana, giving the green light only to the low-THC oils and prohibiting the smokable, high-inducing variety available to anyone with a doctors note in neighboring Maryland and to any adult, in small amounts, in the District. In fact, Virginia has not even formally legalized the oils, providing only an affirmative defense to anyone charged with possession. For that reason, NORML, the nations leading advocate for marijuana legalization, does not include Virginia in its count of 31 states that have legalized medicinal use. Then-Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe holds Haley Smith on his lap in 2015 after signing bills that allow the possession of marijuana oils to help treat patients with epilepsy. (Bob Brown/AP) Virginia is following its own course in creeping into the medical cannabis space, said Jeremy Unruh, director of public and regulatory affairs for PharmaCann, one of 32 companies competing for five permits. Each state has the right and authority to craft a program thats sensitive to the needs and sensibilities of its own local citizens. The companies that ultimately get in on the commonwealths marijuana-oil market will operate within a regulatory framework that sharply limits the number of producers and dictates how they operate from business model (vertical integration) to the clothing worn by workers (no pockets) and the brand name (nothing that screams recreational pot). Those restrictions have hardly been a deterrent. The 32 companies submitted a total of 51 applications some are applying in multiple regions and each bid required a detailed proposal and a nonrefundable $10,000 application fee by the June deadline. The response so far exceeded the expectations of the states Board of Pharmacy that it says it wont decide permits until late September. The state plans to award one permit for each of five regions. Those chosen for conditional permits will have a year to get up and running. A one-year permit will cost $60,000. Much of the selection process is under wraps, with the state maintaining that the identities of applicants are exempt from Virginias Freedom of Information Act. A few of the hopefuls have gone public as theyve pitched their projects to local officials, whose buy-in will be a factor as the committee weighs applications. Among them: a mom-and-pop pharmacist hoping to set up shop in a shuttered J.C. Penney near the Tennessee border and a Hampton home builder seeking to operate out of a former NASA lab. The latter would partner with Arizona Organix, which opened that states first dispensary in 2012. At least two other contenders with out-of-state operations are in the mix. One is PharmaCann, which is based in the Chicago area and operates in Illinois, New York, Massachusetts and Maryland, and is licensed and in the process of building in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. The other out-of-state operator is Surterra Wellness, which is licensed in Florida and Texas and backed by venture capitalists, including chewing-gum heir William Beau Wrigley Jr., who was named chairman of the board this month. It has applied for three of Virginias permits. One would operate out of greenhouses in Waynesboro, the other two in industrial warehouses in Prince William and Amelia counties. Of all the known contenders, Surterra has pushed for medical marijuana in Richmond since 2014. The company donated a total of $50,000 to Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and his predecessor, Terry McAuliffe (D), and is represented by Richmond lobbying powerhouse McGuireWoods. Andrew Smith, who was McAuliffes campaign finance director and later a McGuireWoods vice president, is now a Surterra senior vice president. Surterra founder Jake Bergmann said that if it is selected, the company would invest $10million to $20million in Virginia in the first year and hire a couple hundred employees. At the other end of the spectrum is Dharma Pharmaceuticals, which takes pride in being a purely local start-up. While established outfits have executives and specialists such as master growers, a from-scratch operation will need all new hires, boosting the local economy, said Michael Johnson, a pharmacist in the southwest Virginia community of Abingdon who is leading Dharmas effort. I think thats a benefit for the region, said Johnson, whose group plans to occupy a former J.C. Penneys at the defunct Bristol Mall. Virginia looked like a trailblazer when it approved medical marijuana for people with certain illnesses in 1979. A year earlier, New Mexico had legalized marijuana for medicinal use, but only for a limited number of patients enrolled in a research study. Virginias law, meant to make marijuana available to patients with glaucoma and cancer, seemed far more sweeping. My recollection was that no other state had done that, said former congressman Rick Boucher (D-Va.), who was then a state senator and the chief sponsor of the bill. The medical marijuana measure, part of a broader package of legislation that eased first-offense penalties for possessing or growing small amounts of marijuana, drew little attention or controversy at the time. And it was soon forgotten, because it proved to be useless: It required patients to have a doctors prescription for marijuana, something doctors could not prescribe since it was illegal under federal law. The law drew attention nearly 20 years later, when Del. Robert G. Marshall (R-Prince William) led a repeal effort, but a Senate committee was persuaded to keep it on the books. As other states legalized medical if not recreational marijuana, Virginia resisted the trend. But law-and-order legislators started budging after a 2013 CNN documentary, Weed, showed the plight of a family seeking marijuana oil to control their daughters seizures. The program instantly reshaped the legalization argument into a family-values tear-jerker. Virginia legislators heard from a mother who had moved to Colorado so her daughter could obtain the oils there legally, leaving another daughter behind in Virginia until the strain on the family proved too much. In front of legislators at one hearing, a girl had a seizure. Even so, instead of legalizing the oil, Virginia lawmakers in 2015 passed a measure that would provide only an affirmative defense to shield epileptics and their guardians from prosecution. Provisions for producing the oils in-state had to be scrapped that year, forcing parents to rely on the black market or risk prosecution for buying the oils elsewhere and illegally transporting them across state lines. In the years since, the legislature has loosened the rules so that now the state is preparing for in-state production of the oils, authorized not just for epilepsy but for any medical condition that a doctor thinks can be helped. Patients will need a recommendation rather than a prescription from a physician, and both patient and doctor must register with the state. Jenn Michelle Pedini, executive director of Virginia NORML, said the commonwealths approach is among the strictest in the nation. But among the states operating under hyper-restrictive models, Virginia is sort of the best of the worst, Pedini said, noting that the state will allow the oils to contain up to 5percent THC, compared with 0.5percent in Texas. The state requires that companies grow their own marijuana, produce the oil and sell it all at one location. One contender compares that mandate to requiring that Jim Beam not only grow its own corn, rye and barley, but also do so in the same spot where it distills, bottles and sells its bourbon. The vertical setup is fairly unusual and intended to ensure quality and control the product, Pedini said. Florida has similar requirements, and critics contend that they create huge barriers to entry and limit competition, leading to higher prices and legal drug cartels, as the Tampa Bay Times has put it. The regulations do allow for delivery after patients have an initial, in-person consultation with the companys on-site pharmacist. But the companies have to run the delivery service themselves. Pedini predicts that some of Virginias restrictions will fall away as the state grows more comfortable with the industry. And that is precisely what worries conservatives like Marshall, who lost his reelection bid in 2017 and was shocked to learn that both houses of the legislature voted unanimously this year to broaden use of the oils beyond epileptics. This is like these wagons that went through the Old West, these hucksters who said, This will cure X, Y and Z, he said. This is experimentation, and if its for any illness, this is really wide open.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["N.Y. based blue-chip health care company Cappekula sold about 1,000 machines, R-Technology posted 170,000 job applications, and plans to hire more than 4,000 employees, a spokeswoman said.\nThe investment makes the hard work of racking up the processing fees for a medication marijuana can take up to 60 days, as the Bureau of Justice Research builds a database of use patients could begin receiving medications on Nov. 1.\nCappekula CEO Jeff Azenberger has declared his company\u2019s venture, Commercialized Pot Stereotyped (CFP), to be a marketing opportunity for drug companies. BJS research concluded that the next-generation opioid hits are ripe for legalization and few applications are yet existent, as opposed to background checks.\nThe fact that Azenberger has at least eight current companies competing for his medical marijuana business is a testament to the potential that the U.S. will embrace what America would be, from legalizing marijuana to reimportation of the drug: opportunity that is nearly lost with the FDA\u2019s increasing lack of an adequate regulatory framework.\n\u201cFor everything, we give you a focused revenue stream,\u201d Azenberger said in an interview with The Washington Post. \u201cThis is it.\u201d\nCappekula spent five years developing commercialization tools \u2014 an FDA-approved patent of a pill mill that was approved last week by the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee \u2014 and seeking top FDA board approval, before the FDA did approve it. Azenberger believes the process and potential for approval to be a part of the next year.\nVesseling into commercialization is a new commercial venture that catches a lot of attention. Although not that expensive, it creates the dearth of compelling \"done deals\" from well-heeled drug companies. According to a Senate Committee report, numerous $100 million deals have been signed, including $500 million for D.C.-based pharmaceutical company Radius Health, an excellent example of a pot company that has yet to show any big gains.\nCappekula is best known in the medical marijuana industry for producing its own purified cannabis oil. But another marijuana company, Coloradadans for Biologics, pledged this year to supply the nation\u2019s biggest retail pot shop, Orendo, with 100 machines.\n\u201cIt will be an opportunity to take the clean, centralized infrastructure of medical marijuana and apply it around the world in the hands of consumers,\u201d executive David Noland told the Associated Press in June.\nCappekula was seeded for $10 million by smaller seed-stage investors such as Kogan Pharmaceuticals. But the company has said that the round was the last to leave after a $100 million investment from Trumpish Pincus, who in May is said to be replacing David McCullough as chairman and CEO. Noland\u2019s financial details were sealed last week, although he was not available for an interview.\nWith Cappekula ready to compete with other medical marijuana players, it is not an unlikely story \u2014 commercialization is almost coming soon.\nRead more from The Washington Post\nWashington Post staff writer Eric Walsh contributed to this report.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[46, 14, 57, 14,

(Susan Fry) Star, a petite 6-year-old sheltie who competes in dog agility shows, almost missed a contest this month.She had spent the previous night at the vet, totally stoned on pot. Her drug trip was an accident. Star lives in Oregon, where recreational use of marijuana became legal last year. Her owner's husband had left some loose-leaf pot on the dining room table, and Star got curious. That was days after her sister, Kicker, gobbled upapot-infused hard candy she found in the car, leaving her wobbling and incontinent. A veterinarian gave both dogs activated charcoal to absorb the toxin, which contributed to nearly $3,000 in medical bills and caused Star to poop in the ring during hercompetition. \"It was a bad week,\" said the dogs' owner, Susan Fry, of South Lebanon, Ore. But it was probablya fairly routine week for the clinic that treated the dogs.As more jurisdictions legalize marijuana ,veterinarians across the country say they are seeing a sharp increase in cases of pets accidentally getting high. Tasty \"edibles\" such as muffins and cookies that people consume for a buzz are also appealingto animals, who can't read warning labels, and, in the case of dogs, rarely stop at just one pot brownie. \"Dogs used to kind of chew on the stash growing in the basement. Now they're finding a big bag of gummy bears,\" said Heidi Houchen, a veterinarian at VCA Northwest Veterinary Specialists in a suburb of Portland, which treats a few marijuana cases a week. \"Dogs are Hoovers. Dogs are the rock eaters.\" These incidents, which are rarely fatal, have driven a 330 percent increase over the past five years in calls about pets on pot to the Pet Poison Helpline , said Ahna Brutlag, a veterinary toxicologist who is associate director of the Minnesota-based animal poison control center. Two-thirds of the calls involve marijuana edibles, and nearly all involve dogs, she said. Veterinarians also cited examples of chihuahuaslapping upbong water, cats being exposed to vaping, and even rabbits, ferrets and birds getting accidentally stoned. In the year afterpot became legal for recreational use in Oregon,DoveLewis, a large emergency veterinary clinic in Portland, sawa 63 percent increase in marijuana toxicity cases despite a client base growth of just 7 percent,said Alaina Buller, a clinic spokeswoman. Those findings echoed the results of a 2012 study that found such cases quadrupled at two Colorado veterinary clinics in the five years after medical marijuana was legalized in that state. Nigel, a teacup pig with a big appetite, got even hungrier after eating peanut butter cookies that contained marijuana. (Family photo) As several YouTube videos illustrate, baked pets look a lot like really high people:Glassy-eyed, teetering, lethargic and prettypathetic. In the case of Nigel, a 1-year-old pet teacup pig who was vacationing with his family in Nantucketthis summer, it led to a serious case of the munchies. One member of the family none of whom would agree to be identified in this article had recently been in Colorado, where he had acquired pot peanut butter cookies that were in his backpack. Nigel, who was described as having a voracious appetite when sober, rooted them out and left the empty package as evidence. \"Very soon, we had a very stoned pig on our hands,\" said one witness, a 54-year-old writer who lives in New York City. \"He's just wandering around the kitchen desperate for food, doing a lot of whining and oinking. Then eventually, he just passed out.\" Animals can sleep off a marijuana high in many cases, according to veterinarians interviewed, all of whomsaid they immediatelysuspect the substance when an incontinent pet shows up.Other common toxins, such ascaffeine or pesticides, can be far more dangerous.But veterinarians say there's growingconcernabout the increased potency of today's marijuana edibles, many of which are made withbutters or oils infused withhighly concentratedtetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Many also contain chocolate, which can be fatal to dogs. Marijuana ingestion by animals can lead to vomiting, racing or slowed heart rates, tremors or even seizures. Veterinarians said it is usually treated by inducing vomiting or administering intravenous fluids or anti-nausea medications. In some cases, medications tocontrol heart rates or tremors are necessary. \"Most of them just need a night of detox,\" said veterinarian Shawn Thomas, who owns Tanasbourne Veterinary Emergenc ynear Portland.Theworst cases, Thomassaid, involve owners who have also partaken. He recalled onestandard poodle that washospitalized for more than two days after devouringTHC-infused butter. Its owner, Thomas said,didn't quickly realize the dog was suffering because\"he was blitzed out of his mind, too.\" \"Ten years ago, we would have told you there's no chance your dog is going to die of this,\" he said. \"But now, I tell people, it's so much stronger, and you have a four-pound Chihuahua and it could die.\" Anson Graves and his girlfriend, Tina Pontiff, were amused and then afraid after Rusty found and ate a pot brownie. (Anson Graves) Anson Graves, whose three-poundChihuahua mix ate most of a pot brownie in August, said he really started to worry when the dog still could not walk 12 hours later.Rusty had fallenunder the influence accidentally, according toGraves, a 25-year-old waiter amid the revelry of Bourbon Street in New Orleans, which recently decriminalized marijuana possession . Graves and his friends had stopped for beers and cocktails known as Hand Grenades when, he said, he looked down to see Rusty inhaling a packaged brownie lying on the curb. The labelindicated it contained 60 milligrams of THC, he said. \"I've had my experiences,\" said Graves, who lives in Patterson, La. \"That's quite a bit for a dog.\" Watch more! Anson Graves filmed this video of his dog, Rusty, after the dog ate a pot brownie it found on a New Orleans street in August. (Anson Graves) Half an hour later, Rusty was so lethargic that Graves headed home. The next morning, he was \"like a slinky,\" said Graves, who posted a video of the stoned dog on his Facebook page. He called his vet, who advised rehydrating Rusty by offering himPedialyte.That helped, but the dog wasn't fully recovered until the fourth day, Graves said. \"He was trying to run and jump on the bed. But he'd just hit the bed,\" said Graves, who added that Rusty's New Orleans visits are over.\"That was too much hassle.\" The upshot to wideninglegalization and tolerance of marijuana, veterinarians say, is that pet owners now readily admit when they know their animals have consumed it. In some cases, they even acknowledgehaving given their pets pot for medical purposes, said Lisa Parshley, a veterinary oncologist in Olympia, Wash. Veterinarians are not allowed to prescribe medical marijuana, but Parshley said she had a client who used her own topical cannabis balm on her dog, which had end-stage cancer. \"The dog got a little drunk on the THC,\" said Parshley. \"I convinced her to reduce the dose, and darn if the dog didn't do well for almost another month.\" Veterinarians say the biggest lesson from the increase in stoned pet patients is an obvious one: Pot, like any potentially dangerous substance, needs to be kept out of a pet's reach. Fry said she's now enforcing that with her husband, John, who she said began using marijuana when he contracted multiple sclerosis 30 years ago before it was legal in Oregon.He \"isn't noted for being a super clean guy,\" she said, explaining why he'd left the candy in the car cupholder and the pot on the dining room table. Kicker, the candy-eater, had a particularly strong reaction that left Fry who said she tried marijuana once and was not a fan in tears and worried she would lose the \"feisty little thing.\" But both dogs bounced back Star so well that she performed two of her agility events flawlessly justtwo days after her inadvertent overdose. Next month, both dogs are competing at a national event in Arizona where, luckily for them, there are no drug tests.

(U.S. Senate Drug Caucus) Attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) is a fervent foe of marijuana legalization . But if he were confirmed as President-elect Trump's top law enforcement official, would he really have any power to put his anti-pot views into practice? To review the postelection state of play , a majority of states have legalized medical marijuana and eight (plus the District of Columbia) have legalized recreational marijuana. But the federal Controlled Substances Act still defines production and sale of marijuana as serious crimes. The Obama administration issued policy memos that curtailed federal enforcement of marijuana laws in legalization states. But because such executive branch directives do not bind successive administrations in any way, an Attorney General Sessions could immediately come down on the marijuana industry like a 400 pound bale of pot. One could hardly imagine easier criminal cases for federal prosecutors to make. New York University professor Mark Kleiman points out that \"Every legally licensed marijuana seller filled out and signed a form that documents their intent to commit a federal felony.\" In addition to arresting the owners and operators of marijuana selling companies, Sessions would have broad power under federal law to seize their assets. Actual federal prosecutions may not even be necessary: Simply threatening the industry with aggressive enforcement may be sufficient to induce producers and sellers to close up shop and lead investors to direct their money elsewhere. Would anything constrain Sessions from putting the marijuana industry out of business? In the case of medical marijuana, the answer is almost certainly yes. The prior Congress used the power of the purse to prevent any federal enforcement against medical marijuana sellers and users, and the next Congress will probably be of a similar mind. The Department of Justice therefore couldn't even pay the postage on a letter from the attorney general ordering federal prosecutors into action against medical marijuana providers, no matter how egregiously they flout federal law. The recreational marijuana industry does not enjoy comparable protection because it's concentrated in a smaller number of states and is tied to the political party that was thrashed on election night. The four newly legalizing states (California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada) backed Clinton, and the one state to reject legalization (Arizona) plumped for Trump. With the exception of Alaska, the places that previously legalized recreational marijuana are Democratic Party strongholds (The District of Columbia, Oregon and Washington State). Given those realities, and the fact that political donations by marijuana legalization lobbying groups and the industry go overwhelmingly to Democrats , any political collateral damage of a crackdown may be seen more as a feature than a bug by a Republican-controlled federal government. More generally, although a majority of Americans say they support marijuana legalization when asked by a pollster, that doesn't mean consider it a political priority. Former marijuana policy lobbyist Dan Riffle describes support for legalization as \" a mile wide and an inch deep .\" He adds \"voters don't care enough to march in the streets about it.\" Could the federal response to legal recreational marijuana be something other than Obama's hands-off approach or an industry-wide shutdown? Drug policy analyst Jonathan Caulkins proposes a third way: \"Trump and Sessions could announce national standards for acceptable industry behavior and condition nonenforcement on compliance by marijuana sellers. For example, Sessions could effectively ban marijuana products that are combined with alcohol or tobacco, or which are packaged to look like candies and sodas. Aggressive marketing tactics, such as giving away free grams to entice new customers, could also be blocked.\" Caulkins's vision of the federal government's enforcement role honors the voters' wish to have recreational marijuana legalized while at the same time limiting corporate profit-seeking tactics that could harm public health. Few people expect Sessions to be that Solomonic, but then again not many people expected Nixon to go to China either. 0 Comments Keith Humphreys is a Professor of Psychiatry at Stanford University and is an affiliated faculty member at Stanford Law School and the Stanford Neurosciences Institute.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["With the federal legalization of marijuana now at 5.5 percent of Americans, millions are beginning to look at themselves to be prepared for the worst of the drug war. Yet a new ballot initiative on the table in California\u2019s version of the United States Constitution could get watered down to remain in place.\nThe measure would amend the 1965 Constitution to require that the president be first in line for the presidency. To allow California\u2019s cannabis industry, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein notes, \u201c\u2018Nationals Day\u2019 is becoming the modern day \u2018National Field Day.\u2019 It is a celebration of true science.\u201d\nEven though on Nov. 18 some 20 states and the District of Columbia, including California, voted by an overwhelming majority to allow recreational marijuana use, there are several states \u2014 even some big ones \u2014 that have banned marijuana sales. In Nevada, voters in June approved a measure prohibiting dispensaries and cultivation in the state.\nUnder California law, it is illegal to sell marijuana to minors. \u201cSome might even be allowed to smoke with you,\u201d state Sen. Jeff Stonecipher (D-Santa Monica) explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a legal way to transport a specific substance to a household or to someone who is in possession of some marijuana.\u201d\nAccording to reports, at least 20 states have passed laws that bar people from owning a controlled substance. Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia have all been \u201cunable to establish or enforce\u201d their own prohibitions against controlled substances. Furthermore, some states still issue licenses or make payments to cultivators.\nSo, whether the ballot initiative passes or not, it seems inevitable that California will decide for themselves that it will never be able to legalize recreational marijuana. Almost 50 percent of the state\u2019s voters approved voter-approved marijuana use laws in 2015, a figure that would fall to 7 percent by year\u2019s end.\nIn fact, just last month, a state lawmaker filed a federal lawsuit against Oklahoma\u2019s decision to allow the sale of pot to adult smokers \u2014 who are required to possess two-gum equivalents. In response, Oklahoma was forced to drop its prohibition of pot sales, saying it was because it was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court.\nCalifornia Sen. Feinstein notes that the Constitution required the president to first be first in line. In Congress, that would mean a new federal ban on marijuana being smoked in the United States. Even Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) worries that without a way to lift the ban on cannabis sales, the opportunity to make all cannabis grown outside of Washington state may be too tempting to pass up.\nExperts advise Californians to join the fight against the proposed amendment. \u201cEvery issue going on in this country, we all stand up to back up [National Cannabis Legalization Act] in the Constitution with the Founding Fathers,\u201d Assemblyman Howard Baker (D-California) told the Washington Post.\nAs for the initiative\u2019s prospects in the state Senate, most pundits think it would be overwhelmingly popular. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be in a Senate seat any time soon. I think Californians are not that political. Some people just will believe that the three branches of government want to throw down the gauntlet to bring marijuana to even more people and we should be doing that,\u201d Senator Barbara Boxer (D-California) told the Wall Street Journal.\nAccording to the Washington Post, \u201cWhile the United States Senate is not just about packing the House and occupying the Supreme Court, the Legislature has deep personal and legislative ties in some places and it is likely to be construed as being less sensitive to free speech than many other federal agencies.\u201d\nOriginal Post\n"],

If Republican Gov. Ralph Deleon Guerrero Torres signs the bill, it would make CNMI the first U.S. territory to allow recreational marijuana use, as well as the first locality in the United States to create a commercial marijuana market via legislative action rather than via a voter-driven ballot initiative. This year, lawmakers in Vermont approved a marijuana legalization measure that included no provision for commercial sales. The CNMI bill passed with overwhelming support in both chambers of government: The vote in the House was 18 to 1, with one abstention, while the Senate vote was 6 to 0 with two abstentions . A majority of lawmakers in both chambers are Republican. The population of the Northern Mariana Islands stood at about 52,000 as of July 17 , slightly smaller than the population of Bethesda, Md. But legalization advocates are nonetheless cheering the move. This is a historic moment, as it is the first time a governing body in the United States has ever enacted legislation to both end marijuana prohibition and establish a system of regulation to replace it, Karen OKeefe, director of state policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a statement. Gerry Hemley, co-founder of Sensible CNMI, the group spearheading the initiative in the Northern Mariana Islands, said in a statement that this is an opportunity for the commonwealth to establish itself as a trendsetter on this issue and set an example for the states and other U.S. territories. The CNMI vote comes as the White House is considering ramping up its rhetoric against marijuana use , and the attorney general has rescinded the previous administrations protections for state-legal marijuana businesses. But states that have already legalized recreational marijuana have vowed to protect their own nascent marijuana industries from federal interference. And in November, voters in Michigan and North Dakota will decide whether to legalize recreational use of the drug, while voters in Utah and Missouri will consider medical marijuana proposals. Lawmakers in New Jersey, meanwhile, are considering their legalization bill , and New York's legislature is likely to consider their legalization bill next year . Recreational marijuana sales are expected to begin nationwide in Canada later this year. It appears the Northern Mariana Islands is in good company as they disregard federal saber-rattling on marijuana legalization.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["Four different senators just voted to legalize marijuana in a U.S. territory.\nThe House of Representatives recently voted to adopt new legislation from Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein and Orrin Hatch, a Republican now in charge of Senate marijuana bills.\nThe House has its own marijuana legalization bill due to come up for a vote on November 6. But that vote will have ramifications for the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on marijuana and other forms of medical marijuana.\nAnd that could become a major issue over coming months.\nIn April, the Trump administration issued a new \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy against marijuana use and possession.\nThe administration has now adopted the new policy, imposing a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a fine of $2,500 for possession of \u201ca microgram of marijuana\u201d or more.\nThis came as the Trump administration decided to go a step further, saying it was likely to crack down on marijuana use in exchange for easier access to medical marijuana.\nThat rule applies to the cultivation of marijuana plants, stores, and a large percentage of small amounts sold, and this new policy is based on that now.\nBut it could influence bills throughout the country, not just in the U.S. House.\n\u201cWhat this policy does is it disbands a defense posture, not just against drugs but against law enforcement action,\u201d Philip Landis, who runs the National Cannabis Research & Development Council and represents marijuana legislation, told The Washington Post.\nLandis\u2019s organization also backs the legalization of medical marijuana, but wants the government to rely more on penalties and innovation to stem the flow of pot onto the streets.\n\u201cThis is not just against marijuana advocates; it\u2019s against allowing private operators to grow and possess of it,\u201d Landis said.\nEven if the Trump administration loosens this post-law-enforcement posture and opens it to another policy shift, it\u2019s impossible to say whether the 10-year-old prohibition of some substances may not remain in place.\n"], "gensraw_article":

Randall's regular marijuana supply was cut off several months ago when his ophthalmologist, who provided him with the drug under a government research program, moved out of the Washington area. The settlement was reached this week in connection with a lawsuit that Randall had filed against the U.S. Randall, 30, contended in the suit that laws and policies regulating marijuana distribution denied him his constitutional right to his health. Under the agreement, Randall's current eye doctor will be allowed to supply him with marijuana for at least two years through a Public Health Service pharmacy, according to court records and the U.S. Attorney's office. The drug is supplied to the pharmacy in connection with medical research projects sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the U.S. attorney's office said. Randall has agreed to drop his lawsuit against the government after three weeks if the marijuana supply program is carried out according to the agreement, court records said.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["An estimated 10,000 Vancouver Island residents were recently charged with taking part in a methamphetamine-trafficking ring that took huge profits from an overdose of heroin. A three-year legal battle and a global agreement could soon determine how to conduct major drug deals in the United States.\nIn December, a federal judge in Tacoma, Wash., sentenced one individual to 54 years in prison. Another man charged in the case was sentenced to one year. Two others, all in their 20s, have been remanded to the U.S. Sentencing hearings on July 4 are set for later this year.\nAttorney General Edward V. Chester organized a press conference last week when he announced that Inusual Memorials Inc., the Rikers Island-based company that brought charges against five people in 2001, could seek seven-to-10 years in prison. He said the profits would be on his companies\u2019 books. The companies are Robert Nelson, Director of Group Management, and Janette McCrea, Sentencing Manager, the Attorney General\u2019s Office said in a press release.\nThe company is controlled by Wilbur R. Algieri, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, with the royal influence of former Home Secretary John Sykes, who founded Algieri himself, said Chester. Citing a recent Associated Press report, he says Algieri has continued to influence banking executives.\nJurors deliberated for about seven hours this week before convicting Anna Faris and filing charges against the other two defendants. \u201cAs the state of Virginia sends to jail money that is sought from innocent people in the treatment program for addicts, we must always make sure it\u2019s not used in the treatment of other people,\u201d Chester said.\nThe trial, which began in March, involved 23 suits brought by the world\u2019s first addicts that involved six city jails. Most of the client was acting as his own psychiatrist and counseling patients on certain issues. The program, supervised by officers of the Tacoma County sheriff\u2019s department, police and military, could lead to serious brain damage for a person who smokes illegally, or whose father prescribed Xanax. It could lead to a fear that addicts have trafficked in methamphetamine, a drug that can lead to overdose.\nAttorney General Chester\u2019s report addressed concerns that the fact that drug dealers began to use heroin was showing up in the advertisements in the women\u2019s magazines known as \u201cdrug police\u201d or \u201cdrug courts\u201d which issue advertisements of warning about the dangers of opiate drugs. The report said many of the magazine ads were about recovering addicts who were engaged in a lifestyle of betrayal, dishonesty, and the \u201csmell of compo.\u201d\nSites promoted for opiate addicts include Drug Court International, You\u2019ve seen a lot of magazines featuring such images, Chester said.\nHow to deal with serious brain damage\nDrug courts, which can focus on seriously ill patients, said they hoped to reduce harmful effects of opioid addiction by improving the quality of clinical care.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[2026, 6109, 839, 12, 831, 10931, 5452, 5086, 548, 2905,

Bernardo suggested that student government leaders could help end the spate of drug arrests in the county schools by exerting \"peer pressure\" on their fellow-students and persuading them to stop smoking marijuana. Yesterday, the student government leaders said they had a better plan for stopping the arrests; the state, they said, should decriminalize marijuana use. \"For millions of young people who are defined as criminals under the current marijuana laws, these laws only increase their disrespect and bitterness for the entire legal system,\" said John Heilprin, a junior at Walt Whitman High School. \"They resent being defined as criminals in a society which permits, and even encourages through advertising, the use of such proven unhealthy and dangerous drugs as alcohol and tobacco,\" added Heilprin, who drafted a resolution passed by more than half of the 100 high school delegates assembled for a regular meeting yesterday. The resolution, however, said that students who smoke marijuana on school grounds or during school hours should be subject to the same severe school penalties that now cover students who drink alcohol at school. As the students were convening, however, Montgomery County police officers were arresting eight young people on drug charges. The arrests at three high schools brought to 139 the number of young people arrested since the police began cracking down on drug use at county schools last month. Yesterday, two Gaithersburg High School students and three Sherwood High School students were arrested and charged with possession of marijuana. Three others were charged with possession of PCP. Charged with possession of PCP are 19-year-old Gerald Garland Weaver, 8701 Woodfield Ct., Gaithersburg; a 17-year-old student at Damascus High School, and a 17-year-old girl who recently graduated from Damascus High School. The three were arrested in a car near Damascus, where police followed them after allegedly spotting the three using drugs in the school parking lot. The 17-year-old girl also was charged with concealing a deadly weapon. Police said she had a sawed-off shotgun, a .22 automatic rifle and a 16-gauge shotgun. The weapons were not registered. Yesterday's passage of the decriminalization resolution by the Montgomery County Regional Association of Student Councils proves the way for the Maryland Association of Students Councils to consider the same question at its convention this fall. If the resolution is passed there, the association's legislative council would lobby state legislators to pass a measure to decriminalize marijuana. But Alan Goldstein, a lawyer for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said decriminalization of marijuana by a state might not have much effect on juveniles. \"The decriminalization bill that we have before the legislature has always been limited to the statute that affects adults,\" he said. \"It would make possession of marijuana a civil infraction like a parking violation. Juveniles might still be brought before juvenile court.\" In another resolution, passed yesterday, students said that drugs should not be used on school grounds, even if marijuana is eventually decriminalized. They called use of drugs during school hours a source of \"concern and abhorrence.\" But they asked for an end to \"police-initiated\" arrests of students using drugs until student delegates meet school officials and police to discuss alternate ways of curbing drug use during school hours. In that resolution students also asked for durg education programs for adults as well as students. \"Some parents have to learn that smoking marijuana isn't the same as shooting up heroin,\" Heilprin said.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["Carlsbad, Calif.\u2014Philip P. Clevenger, president of the California Board of Education, told a packed Assembly hearing on the subject Saturday that his school for 80 years had been told not to use marijuana, taking at least three suspected hooligans from his school to task for it. Clevenger said the legislation that he was proposing would not stop criminalizing marijuana use but would hinder one of the state\u2019s biggest employers in the process.\n\u201cAs we talk about legalizing the use of marijuana and other criminal drugs here in California, I hope that the president will encourage teachers to be the first to agree that, no, they don\u2019t think they should ever use marijuana,\u201d Clevenger said, adding that efforts to end tobacco use have \u201cgotten stronger each year.\u201d Clevenger testified as California Attorney General Ronald A. Marban was trying to block newly legalized use of the drug. It is illegal to smoke tobacco in California.\nSince 1989, only 20 of the state\u2019s more than 24,000 high schools have adopted pot laws, says the Chronicle of Higher Education. Of the universities that have now shown an interest in legalizing marijuana, 75 take the issue seriously, mostly by enjoining communities or colleges and colleges and colleges affiliations. Seventeen states, including California, require incivorous adults to take their own marijuana.\nCalifornia\u2019s legislature has carried out a widespread legalization push and small-schools in California, Seattle, New York, Baltimore, and Washington are among the \u201crestrictive\u201d places prohibiting marijuana.\nNancy Maestas, president of the National Governors Association, testified that pot remains a misunderstood drug. Her organization calls it \u201ca supergroup\u201d in prison, and hints that \u201cthe military has defined pot as \u2018marijuana.'\u201d Under the National Grades Administration, incarceration has been reduced by a half in California from 16 in 1978 to 17 this year.\nAdvocates argue that nonviolent drug offenders with \u201cgood records\u201d are far less likely to seek legal treatment than drug offenders who have failed to grasp the limits of their responsibilities as adults.\nSuzanne Margamund, director of the California Prison Legal Defense Network, cited several recent progress reports in the state, such as the 1981 Reason Magazine\u2019s list of the 50 fastest-growing states. Margamund cited a Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services report recently created by its Child Development Institute, which found a record 15.8 percent drop in violent crime among youths 15 to 17. Nationwide, violent crimes fell 14 percent between the years 1979 and 1981, she said.\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures makes nearly 20,000 plans for expanding the use of marijuana in the next two years, \u201cbut never before has a legal pot provision been promoted in this way,\u201d Margamund said.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[26887, 83, 14775, 12, 3193, 13403, 18674, 542, 351, 14,

In a recently completed Gallup Poll, majorities of the public agree not only that it is physicially harmful (55 per cent) and addicitive (59 per cent) but also that it leads to hard drugs (59 per cent) such as heroin. While these findings are doubtless discouraging to marijuana advocates, the percentage of Americans who believe the substance is harmful (down 11 points) and who think it leads to hard drug use (down 16 points) have both declined significantly since 1972. The percentage who believe it is phsically addictive has remained at about the same level as recorded in 1972. Analysis of the findings for all three questions - is marijuana physically harmful, is it habit forming, does it lead to hard drug use - reveals sharp contrasts in attitudes by sex, edication, age, and region of the nation. [WORD ILLEGIBLE] each of these population groups is generally the same on all three questions. For example: Men are more likely to agree with the pro-marijuana viewpoint on all questions than are women; The higher the education of the respondent, the more likely one is to hold a pro-marijuana viewpoint. In all three cases, those with only a grade school education are the most conservative in their beliefs, with the high school-educated falling between; Younger adults (under 30) are most likely to have a pro-marijuana viewpoint wiht the 30-49-year-old group significantly more anti-marijuana, and those over 50 years old most convinced of its harmful qualities; People living in the Northeast and far West are more apt, on all three questions, to have a pro-marijuana viewpoint than are Midwesterners and Southeners. Yesterday, the Gallup Poll reported that the percentage of Americans who have sample marijuana at least once has risen to 24 per cent with about half these having tried it during the last year. Analysis of the views of persons who have tried marijuana reveals a not unecpected consistency. Those who have never tried marijuana are, in all three cases, more likely to accept the anti-marijuana view than are users. And among users, those whose contact with the substance was more than one year ago have uniformly more anti-marijuana views than currents users.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["A poll conducted by the Washington Post says that marijuana addiction is much less likely to lead to first-time substance use than drinking and smoking cigarettes. In Washington state, marijuana is reportedly the new favorite drug in the national poll.\nAccording to the Post, a pot known as the Chiquita and the Los Angeles range are often used in \"underemployment, stress, depression, anxiety, food safety, sports and other daily activities.\" Surprisingly, marijuana is now a socially acceptable and present danger of the kind of risky activity that could damage someone's prospects of becoming one of the 87 million recreational pot users in the United States. More specifically, college students routinely demand illegal drugs from their roommates, citing the high price of marijuana in college tuition and their inability to pass their student loan payments on a successful credit record. In other words, several college students claimed that cannabis is a good deal. According to another recent survey by ABC News, a majority of college students believe marijuana is more problematic than alcohol, and a surprising 60 percent of them share marijuana's position in their college drinking research.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[33, 3279, 5953, 417, 263, 2670, 2948, 1140, 327, 5728, 13231, 319, 882, 1343, 1885, 285, 1086, 285, 718, 13, 2436, 9137, 780, 622, 7723, 291,

But even before his drug abuse message to Congress was made public, the President's White House adviser on drug abuse, Dr. Peter Bourne, told reporters that federal decriminalization of marijuana is \"not that important in the big picture\" and that its significance in the message \"is more symbolic than real.\" The bulk of the message, when Carter introduced in a personal appearance in the White House press briefing from dealt with a series of studies and directives aimed at expanding and strengthening federal drug abuse efforts and placing coordination of those efforts under the White House. The President did not propose administration legislation to decriminalize marijuana, nor did he urge the states to end their own criminal penalties for possession of a small amount of the drug - generally defined as one ounce of less. Instead, he said he would leave it up to the states to enact or repeal their own laws and he supported legislation pending in Congress that would impose federal civil penalties rather than criminal penalties for the possession of an ounce or less of marijuana. Federal law now has a penalty of one year in prison, a $5,000 fine or both for possession of marijuana. There is no federal civil penalty for possession. There are currently two Capitol Hill dealing with the subject. One would simply end the criminal penalty of a $100 fine for possession. In effect, Carter endorsed the latter measure, whose chief sponsors are Sens. Jacob K. Javits (R-N.Y) and Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). The President, whose three sons have acknowledged experimenting with marijuana, primised during his campaign last year to seek to desriminalize marijuana. In doing so yesterday, however, he appeared to take the most cautious approach open to him - endorsing pending legislation rather than proposing his own and stopping short of urgin the states, which prosecute almost all marijuana offenders, to follow suit. According to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, a Washington-based lobbying group, in 1975 there were 416,000 arrests under state laws for possession of marijuana. Of these, 93 per cent were for possession of a small amount - generally one ounce or less. That same year, there were 4,000 arrests under the federal law Carter seeks to change, almost all of them involving traffickers who possessed more than one ounce, according to the organization. The White House estimated that 45 million Americans have experimented with marijuana and that 11 million use the drug regularly. In a telephone interview, Bourne said that while the President did not urge the states to decriminalize possession of marijuana, his endorsement of the pending federal legislation \"signals certain message.\" Some proposals in the message may draw criticism from civil libertarians. Carter, for example, ordered a Justice Department study of the possibility of denying release from jail before trial of persons charged with major drug trafficking offenses. he also ordered studies on the possibility of revoking the passports and freezing the financial assets of known drug traffickers, and of easing restrictions on government access to personal financial data of known drug dealers. The President also ordered studies on the use of barbiturates, including the prescribing practices of physicians, an audit of drug manufacturing frims and the use of sedative hypnotic drugs that are particularly subject to abuse. Bourne said he considered the President's emphasis on international cooperation to eliminate the sources of such drugs as heroin to be among the must important aspects of the message. \"Even under optimum circumstances, only about 10 per cent of the heroin can be eliminated by law enforcement efforts,\" Bourne said. The rest must be eliminated at the source of the drug in foreign countries , among them Mexico, he said.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["''There is a cultural foundation in this country that can be traced back to the Constitution of the United States. Its ideas are applicable to all of our laws.'' In an historic speech attended by President Carter yesterday, General David Duke declared ''We are here in this country to demand that we outlaw all drugs. ... Government, so long as drugs and drugs do not cause violence, and injure or kill any person, must provide legal remedies and alternatives.''\nIt is thought that the term criminalizing drugs has been mentioned, and has been changed, repeatedly as part of President Carter`s program for ending the nation`s drug war. It had been the blueprint that promised a legal recovery and rehabilitation for society at large. But last November in a long struggle between the Supreme Court and Congress, the Supreme Court declined to take up the case. It`s unclear, however, whether it will stop all the Drug War.\nThe controversial policy might actually be implemented this fall, officials predicted. But until then it remains to be seen whether the courts would quickly decide.\nThe Texas Supreme Court recently ruled that marijuana growers might be fined up to $1,500 for the first felony possession under drug laws. Gov. George W. Bush has threatened to veto the measure, saying it would compromise the battle over the drug war.\nCattle can be bred on a far less restrictive ethical governing of the landscape.\nDrugs or not, Carter will be sworn in on September 1 to replace Dwight Eisenhower. He will be paid $365,000 a year, plus $42,300 in a parachute. And he will step down from his Cabinet soon afterward.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[7062, 1859, 319, 258, 6468, 8490, 288, 429, 1500, 327, 461, 308, 23247, 737, 285, 263, 7966, 287, 263, 1579, 1830, 14,

Perry Bullard, who his made marijuana decriminalization a personal crusade, Calling Bullard a \"pot smoker,\" she picked up an ashtray and gave her colleague a whack on the head. Bullard wasn't seriously injured. Nor has political retribution been visited on legislator who've decided it makes no sense to burden offenders - mostly young people - with the stigma of prison sentences and criminal records for possessing small amounts of grass. \"No legislator in the state of Oregon has been defeated because of his vote for decriminalization. Not one, \"Oregon State Sen. Ed Bagley told a National Conference of State Legislators panel in Detroit last month. Nine states have eased up dramatically on their marijuana laws, generally making it a simple civil infraction if a person is caught with an ounce or less of the drug. Oregon was the first state to act, in 1973, Alaska, California, Maine, Colorado, Minnesota and just this year, Mississippi, New York and North Carolina have followed. As a result, fully a third of the American people can now smoke the onetime symbol of decadence, evil and '60s radicalism without fear of anything more serious than a $100 fine, given out like a traffic citation. The decrimination effort received a major boost recently when President Carter, making good on a campaign promise, asked Congress to reduce the federal penalty for possession of an ounce of marijuana from a $5,000 fine, a year in jail, or both, to a civil fine - probably $100. The President's stand should help persuade a still-reluctant Congress to change the federal law, says Keith Stroup, founder of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML). Even more important, Stroup says, the presidential stamp of approval should help persuade legislators to change state laws under which as astounding 416,000 marijuana arrests were made in 1975 - 93 per cent for possessing a small amount. \"People know that Jimmy Carter is not a social liberal,\" Stroup notes. \"He's a compassionate man who has three sons who admit they have been marijuana users in the past - one of whom received a less-than-honorable discharge from the Navy as a result. His kids are not criminals, they're decent people. The fact that Jimmy Carter has come to grips with this on a personal basis makes it far easier for a lot of people to come to grips with it as well.\" By 53 to 41 per cent, Americans favor removing criminal penalities for possessing small amounts of marijuana, the Gallup Poll says. What's causing the more lenient public attitude? There seem to be three major reasons: Widely reported evidence that experimental or intermittent use of marijuana does not cause physical or psychological harm of dependency. Even with decriminalization, usage doesn't rise appreciably - only 3 per cent, Oregon and California studies indicate. No brain damage from marijuana use has been documented, unlike the well proven brain damage of alcohol. A growing feeling that stiff laws alone will never stamp out marijuana use. \"If we were to round up every kid in Sunflower County who smoked marijuana, we wouldn't have enough left to hold Sunday school,\" C.O. Sessums Jr., president of the Mississippi legislature. And the drug, notes Dr. Peter Bourne, Carter's assistant for health matters, can be cultivated in every state. Increasing belief that jail and a permanent criminal record are more harmful to the marijuana user than the drug. There are stories of person rapes and even suicide among jailed marijuana users. \"Our prisons are overcrowded, and yet were sending kids to jail for minor pot offenses. It just didn't make sense,\" says State Rep. Alan Adams, chief sponsor of North Carolina's decriminalization statute. Decriminating marijuana, advocates say, frees up criminal justice money and staff to deal with more serious drug problems and serious crimes. California localities saved an estimated $25 million in court costs in six months following decriminalization - and also earned $800,000 in fines. Drug control, Bourne says, should concentrate on life-endangering drugs. \"People die from heroin, barbiturates, a minimal amount from cocaine, quite a bit from other hypnotic drugs and not at all from marijuana,\" he notes. But he opposes full legalization of marijuana: \"If you legalize it, it will be pushed, commercialized, condoned and people will encourage its use, which we don't want to do.\" It's undersirable, Bourne says, to have young people intoxicated with the drug for a significant percentage of the time, and there's an apparently of the time, and there's an apparently high correlation between marijuana and auto accidents. Up to now, opposition to decriminalization has been strong in many states. Maryland, Missouri, Maine, New Jersey, New Hampshire and New Mexico all have turned down milder penalties since the decriminalization drive began. The issue's still pending this year in Michican and Wisconsin. \"We're not going to go out and lobby the states for decriminalization,\" Bourne told me. But the President's position, he hopes, will \"set a tone with some kind of impact on leadership in state legislatures around the country.\"", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["Less than three months after president Carter set up the National Cannabis Industry Task Force, the Virginia legislature finally accepted an I-74 Roadmap proposal and would relax penalties for possession of more than 500 grams of pot.\nThat bill, S. 2939, was to have first been passed this past spring, and obviously lasted until the session ended last Monday. Now all we can hope for is that some money is flowing in, and that many of the folks who thought it was a good idea have finally signed up.\nOn the day it came through the General Assembly last fall, thousands gathered in Virginia\u2019s midtown (and everybody from Mayor Byron W. Brown to Betty Ford) to protest what they described as the act of \u201cgrafting,\u201d the process of hand-holding, the use of the federal government to control the marketplace by racketeering corporations and other groups.\nA large pot plant was kept hidden in an Irishman\u2019s bedroom near Waverly and Harp Hill in Richmond. Now, instead of a flame rising from his bedroom window and being nailed down, it was braced, somewhere between 100 and 2,000 pounds of pot. After all that, an unofficial licence application for the site was accepted, thereby creating some paperwork around the old mine site.\nOne of those new licensees is in prison. He grew up in Richmond and opened a small operation where he sold more than 50,000 pounds of pot in the fall of 1981. He now works at the pot plant, but has taken his time and wasn\u2019t quite sure how far along he was in the process of developing his business. \u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to be doing it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI just wanted to make money,\u201d said Matthew Smith, who grew up in Richmond and now serves as executive director of the NCI Youth Council. \u201cI want my kids to go to college. It just seemed wrong to punish the people who were using it.\u201d\nSmith, Smith, John Simon and Pat Fisher, all political activists, were among the signatories to the 1994 V-74 Study Report \u2013 which stated that marijuana use during adolescence is illegal and ought to be decriminalized. Part of the reason is because, during that time, the youth, concerned for the safety of kids growing up, do not have much time to engage in underage consumption. In other words, they don\u2019t have enough time to go to the beach or sit under a tree.\nMuch to his dismay, the report declared that the use of marijuana during adolescence is illegal, with an increased risk of substance abuse compared to intravenous drug use and imbibing. Smith said he was well aware of the potential dangers of possessing the small amount of marijuana. He spent the summer pushing for an adult-administered ban on the use of marijuana at home.\nAt least one other state Legislature co-sponsored the regional study, requiring a two-month waiting period for commercial businesses to demonstrate they have a right to sales and use of cannabis in the state. But the proposal died of opposition after the legislature decided to adjourn.\nSmith said he\u2019s hopeful that one day, the state could reach a compromise to let the recreational use of marijuana before recreational use.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[22059, 622, 1116, 1934, 707, 1894, 10832, 901, 511, 263, 2352, 28839, 17421, 15942, 5222, 12, 263, 6026, 15929, 3444, 6293, 282, 315, 13, 4525, 5568,

Gone are the traveling cannabis caravans of doctors infamous for signing up hundreds of medical marijuana hopefuls in a single day. The vast majority of the nearly 30,000 patients and 4,900 providers that once flooded this state of just more than 1 million people have been driven out of Montanas medical marijuana program, which was first legalized in 2004. These days, those who remain in the states medical marijuana system deal in a combination of currency and uncertainty as they await the outcome of a state Supreme Court case that could cripple whats left of the industry. A decision could come as soon as October, according to James Goetz, a lawyer who represents the medical marijuana industry. Depending on the courts ruling, medical marijuana providers could be banned from charging patients a penny, save recouping $50 license fees and renewals. Providers could be limited to three patients each. And the businesses could be blocked from advertising. As medical marijuana consumers cry foul, state legislators and grassroots opposition have sought to undermine the industry, saying business grew too large, too fast in effect becoming recreational marijuana operating under the guise of medicine. Marijuana has been contested in the state so long that people dont recognize the direness of the situation this time around, according to Elizabeth Pincolini, who runs a referral service based in Billings that connects patients to the few doctors left willing to regularly write marijuana recommendations. Elizabeth Pincolini is a medical marijuana user and advocate, who aims to connect patients with doctors. (Martin do Nascimento/News 21) Its really out of our hands, Pincolini said. Theres nothing we can do. We can write letters and do our best to appeal to the common sense of the Supreme Court, but we really cant do anything. A medical marijuana program in turmoil After Montanans in 2004 voted 62percent to38 percent to legalize medical marijuana, the program grew at first in small spurts. But it ballooned in late 2009, after the U.S. Department of Justice said it wouldnt interfere with state-compliant medical marijuana patients and providers. From 3,921 patients and 1,403 providers in September 2009 one month before the Justice Department announcement the program grew to 29,948 patients and 4,848 providers by March 2011. As the system swelled and pot shops opened a stones throw from schools in Butte and across the street from churches in Billings, an opposition movement was born. There were medical marijuana distribution sites next to churches and the junior high, said Steve Zabawa, a prominent funder of the anti-marijuana movement in Billings, where he owns a chain of car dealerships. You could just see that the traffic going in and out had nothing to do with medicine. Basically, the black market went to the regular market, and it popped up everywhere. In March 2011, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration conducted raids across the state, the culmination of an 18-month investigation into whether the medical marijuana businesses were involved in large-scale drug trafficking and other federal crimes. Shops were closed down, and their operators went on to be charged under federal drug laws. The DEA did not return multiple calls for comment. Several attempts at legislative repeal of medical marijuana followed the raids, targeting the few businesses still open. The program came a signature away from dissolution in April 2011, when then-Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat, vetoed a repeal bill passed by the Legislature. Later in that same legislative session, lawmakers pushed through SB 423 widely known as repeal in disguise, which was signed into law in May 2011. Under the law, providers couldnt charge a cent for services, save recouping license application fees, so they had no incentive to stay open. The laws future now hinges on the outcome of the Supreme Court decision. Nearly 30,000 patients had been reduced to less than 9,000 by June 2012. The restrictive law, which limited each provider to three patients, cut the number of providers to less than 400, down from a June 2011 height of nearly 5,000. Dubbed one of the most restrictive laws in the country by Roy Kemp, interim administrator of the agency that regulates the medical marijuana program, SB 423 allows for providers, but not dispensaries. Larger providers allowed for now under a judges order operate storefronts with regular hours. They stock assorted strains, from Blue Dream to OG Kush to Black Cherry Soda. They have registers full of cash and stickers with logos and menus with prices. But they cant technically refer to their operations as a dispensary. They cant technically call what they do business. Its interesting that they call dispensary a loaded term, said Carly Dandrea, a budtender for Around the Clock Cannabis in Bozeman and a fifth-generation Montanan. I take offense to that. Its what we do. Its who we are. The law doesnt give the state much leeway. There are no dispensaries that exist in the state of Montana, Kemp said. The law doesnt allow for them. Thats not what we do here. A contentious legal history has led the industry to the shaky ground on which it today stands. After members of the marijuana industry sued to block SB 423, state District Judge James Reynolds, in June 2011 blocked three of the most restrictive measures of the states medical marijuana law: a ban on providers charging patients except to recover small license and renewal fees, a ban on advertising and a maximum of three patients per provider. But the Montana State Supreme Court ordered Reynolds to reassess the law under a less-strict standard. In January 2013, Reynolds confirmed his original ruling in a second temporary injunction and he made the ruling permanent in January 2015. Montana Attorney General Tim Fox appealed that ruling, the states Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments once more and briefs have been filed by both sides. Fox and his attorneys have defended SB 423 by arguing that Reynolds erred in interpreting the law. A spokesman for Fox declined to make the attorney general available for comment, saying it would be inappropriate with litigation pending. The outcome of the Supreme Court case could bring about the end of an era and of an industry. Its hard for patients to live like that, not knowing if theyll have their cards next year, Pincolini said. She added, Its pretty desperate. Its a pretty desperate situation. As 23 states, plus Washington, D.C., have eased restrictions on medical marijuana with more expected to follow Montana has been the only one to head in the opposite direction. Montana seems to be the only state that seems to be going backwards after having had a medical marijuana law, said Mort Reid, the president of the Montana Cannabis Industry Association, a trade group and party in the Supreme Court case. The other states seem to be moving forward. So, the big question is, What makes Montana different from other states, and why cant they make it work in Montana? State Sen. David Howard, a Republican, supported attempts to repeal or restrict marijuana in the 2011 legislative session when he served in the House. Calling marijuana a scourge coming to America, Howard helped lead the movement against the drug in Montana. It doesnt take you very long to figure out that (marijuana is) not medicine, Howard said, adding that hes still for repeal of the 2004 law today. Thats what they wanted you to think it was medicine. It has no practical applications, and it was tearing apart Montana. Zabawa, the Billings car dealer, has tried in the past to gather enough signatures for a marijuana repeal initiative on the ballot, but fell short of the necessary number in 2014. Hes now gathering signatures for another voter initiative supporting all-out repeal of medical marijuana in the 2016 election. The remnants of the raids In the middle of a Monday morning, March 11, 2011, Mark and Valerie Sigler, husband and wife co-owners of Big Sky Patient Care, one of the largest medical marijuana providers in the state, pulled up to their location near Bozeman to check in on things. But the open sign was off. The parking lot was empty. Something wasnt quite right. Stepping inside, the couple was greeted by rifle-wielding, riot-gear-wearing federal agents standing watch over a handful of employees handcuffed on the ground. The Siglers had waltzed right into the middle of their own personal federal drug raid. Id probably have been shot today, because I was in their faces screaming at them, telling them that we were state-compliant, said Valerie Sigler, still shaking more than four years later. So, what were they doing there? The Siglers operation was one dozens of businesses raided across Montana by federal authorities that day. Many providers went on to face federal charges, and almost all accepted probation or house arrest to avoid jail time. The Siglers received five years of probation, which theyre both still serving, plus suspended jail time for Mark and house arrest for both. But becoming felons was just the beginning. From 400-plus patients and more than $1 million in the bank, the middle-aged couple have sunk into more than $1 million in debt including a combined $900,000 judgment, payable to the federal government. Their seven grown children, most of whom used to work in the family marijuana business, have been scattered across different states, working odd jobs far from home. Mark and Valerie Sigler walk in the woods surrounding their home outside Bozeman, Mont. (Martin do Nascimento/News 21) The Siglers are about to lose their home, a log cabin in the middle of the forest near Bozeman. Mortgage payments have been hard for a couple of felons lacking a steady income. Mark, a cancer patient, is unemployed. Valerie is back at school, piling on more debt in a bid to turn things around with a dual-degree in geology and liberal arts from Montana State University. You can just keep going, or you can shoot yourself in the head. But you dont have very many choices other than that, Mark Sigler said. Its never going to go away for us. Well, lets face it we were all illegal, he added. Still selling, but quietly, this time Tucked in the corner of a nondescript office park on the edge of Missoula, the woman behind a small medical marijuana operation quietly harvests a dozen plants each month to keep her 70 patients supplied with product. There are no pot leaf stickers marking the spot, no searchable blurbs on Leafly or Weedmaps, no strain menus to peruse within. From the outside, its as if the business never existed. The owner, a wary middle-aged women who has been there since 2009, likes it that way. Nightmares of the raids of 2011 remain. She watched as two businesses in the same office park were raided, product destroyed in the street, charges filed and lives upended. The owner of the Missoula dispensary tends to marijuana plants which are grown in the same location as the storefront. (Martin do Nascimento/News 21) Anytime someone got in the limelight, they were picked off, said the woman, who asked not to be identified for fear of federal prosecution. Whac-a-Mole, thats what it reminded me of. Anytime you stuck your head up, it was like, Whack! Most of the industry today keeps a lower profile than it once did. Providers have reduced hundreds of patients to dozens, or even handfuls. Millions of dollars in revenue has fallen into the thousands. The downsizing has been driven by recurring fears of federal interference into what the state is permitting for now. The 442 providers down from a 2011 high of nearly 5,000 still around are careful. They say they have to be. Out east, Billings, the largest city in Montana, with a population of just under 110,000, is home to just one storefront. The dozens of dispensaries that once dotted the streets are all gone, run out of business by raids and regulation. Rich Abromeit and Jason Smith, owners of the last marijuana storefront within the city limits, Montana Advanced Caregivers, rattle off a laundry list of protections checking cards meticulously, keeping patient and plant counts in check, staying away from illegal edible extractions they say have kept them out of trouble since they opened the shop in 2008. Im a bulls-eye, Smith said, glancing behind his back at rows of labeled pot plants. Im the last shop left in this town, and everyone depends on me. Buying illegally outside the system Jon Svaren, a bearded 15-year Navy veteran, has been living out on his aunts farm off dirt roads near Hardin, in the eastern part of the state, where attitudes toward marijuana tend to be harsher. Svaren breaks the law more days than not. Hes an unapologetic pot-smoker, self-medicating for a spinal fusion and years of back pain that intensify with long hours of labor logged feeding sheep and tending to crops. The pot comes from the black market. Vaporizing, as is his preference, four to five times a day could land him in jail. Not that he cares much. Put me before a jury of 12, Svaren said, between swigs of homemade lemonade served cold from a Vlasic pickle jar. Id be happy to explain myself to them. The tens of thousands of patients who have left the system havent stopped smoking, he said, smirking at the idea. Theyve gone to the black market, where there is no registry, no threat of the state turning against the system once more. In turning to the black market, many find an ironic sense of safety. An open violation type of guy, the libertarian-leaning Svaren refused to renew his medical card after the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in 2011 prohibited medical marijuana patients from owning firearms. Svaren, who likes to go duck-hunting and keeps an eye out for bears wandering through the farm (its happened before), has quite the gun collection. Though Svaren ditched the system early, others, too, are planning for a future with limited options for procuring marijuana if the Supreme Court rules against the industry. Because providers would be prohibited from making a profit, the black market or growing at home would be the only viable option for patients, according to Josh Daniels, a patient advocate living in the suburbs of Billings. Home-growing, though, presents problems of its own. The law doesnt allow patients a legal way to procure seeds or clones. Hows that supposed to work? asked Daniels, between deep drags of a hand-rolled cigarette. Hes also a patient, growing marijuana to deal with his multiple sclerosis. A magic seed fairy is going to deliver seeds in your mailbox? To grow, the first thing you have to do is break the law. Les Yother, a recently retired 63-year-old former laborer, lives a couple hundred miles west of Daniels and Svaren, a long, winding ride on Interstate 90 away, across two-lane stretches that meander through an empty expanse of green dotted with the occasional farm. Miles pass between each exit until his hometown, Butte, once known as the richest hill on Earth for its vastly profitable copper mines, comes into view. As Montanasmedical marijuana system grew, pot businesses started popping up across from churchesand near schools, including in the city of Butte, shown here. (Martin do Nascimento/News 21) The town of nearly 34,000 has a rough-and-tumble, heavy-drinking history. Here, in the midst of blue-collar households and aging infrastructure, medical marijuana has by and large found a safe haven. Dispensaries downtown still advertise, plastering phone numbers and websites outside. Men linger drinking beer in the middle of the day down a main thoroughfare, Montana Street, taking advantage of a loose open container law. Pot seems to raise few eyebrows. The birthplace of Evel Knievel, Butte tends toward a live-and-let-live attitude when it comes to marijuana a sharp contrast to the other parts of Montana. Yother was one of the first to get a card in 2004, patient 69 in the registry. Since then, Yother said, its gone back and forth so many times that no one can keep track. A former alcoholic, Yother credited marijuana with settling his demons. The cardholder smokes about two grams a day to manage his glaucoma and relieve pain from a bad back that has him hunched almost in half from years of hard labor. If the Supreme Court rules against the industry, Yother would keep on puffing pot out of a residue-streaked green metallic pipe: Oh, Id go black market, he said. Hanging on, industry faces uncertain future Gibbons picks a leaf off of one of his indoor marijuana plants. (Martin do Nascimento/News 21) The direction and destination of marijuana in Montana hangs in the uneasy balance. The status quo has left providers and patients in a vacuum of fear and uncertainty, unsure what the Supreme Court will decide in the months to come. A Reefer Madness poster stared down on Mark Gibbons Jr., the self-proclaimed longest-running provider in Montana as he mulled over what might come next. Gibbons, the owner of Buttes Montana Natural Medicine, which served 500 patients at its height in early 2011, has weathered setbacks before: failed crops, dropped customers. He once cycled through 10 pounds of marijuana per month thats down to two or so, for his 40 remaining patients. Perched behind the counter, beneath an Against SB 423 sticker, opposite a University of Montana diploma tucked between a couple of Yellowstone National Park shot glasses, Gibbons sighed in frustration at shifting regulation he says he still doesnt fully understand. If the court rules against the industry, Gibbons has a backup plan to make ends meet: accepting donations, not payment, from patients, not customers. With a lot of patience and a few creative solutions, cannabis ought to survive in the state, he said. Itll just be less, Gibbons said. Itll be less plants and less money and less patients getting treatment.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["Sorry, Montanas\u2014Here\u2019s the catch: Since in 2014, Montanas, a Delaware-based medical marijuana operator, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware and agreed to dissolve as an independent company, landing seven California locations and making its owners the first North American chain of medical marijuana dispensaries to do so.\nDuring those seven years, Montanas has operated more than 2,400 locations serving an estimated 16 million people across Delaware, Texas, Kentucky, Iowa, Michigan, Oklahoma, and Tennessee.\nBut the company faces new challenges in California, where the system will expire August 31, and patients can be offered financial protections.\nEven if Montanas shares its $49 million commercial financing with private investors, it\u2019s still unclear what the medical marijuana industry will look like if its facilities are shut down altogether.\n\u201cWe certainly think the industry would be more attractive to the state if the governor removed the prohibition of medical marijuana,\u201d Montanas Chief Executive Ed Conyers said.\nUnder law, Delaware law allows privately-owned medical marijuana providers to suspend operations temporarily, but every three years or more, the state has come up with rules that govern the effects of marijuana use. They are usually phased in over a 30-year period, going forward, in the middle of the fourth year of the pot industry\u2019s 21st century boom.\nMontanas, which already has served 1,500 patients in the Delaware system, hopes to serve 8,000 patients this year, a number that the company says could increase to 17,000 by 2021.\nIn a new development last month, the company received approval from the Delaware Retail Retail Commission to have its assets returned to the state, and with it, a national expansion plan. During an interview last month, Conyers said there are tentative plans to bring 16 of the state\u2019s 30 medical marijuana plants, which previously were operated by others, up to statehood.\nLast week, there was a heated rally at Montanas\u2019s Hillside restaurant, a new location on California Avenue where five of the six founding partners are from the cannabis business.\nJamie S. Berman, a lawyer representing the company, said her team had been waiting to see what the company would gain from that deal. Bidding prices are much lower than sites that are profitable, so they might reflect better sales results, Berman said.\nShe added: \u201cThe only real threat to the industry is to become closed-mouth, without explanation, marijuana addicts or caregivers.\u201d\nBerman said she \u201creally is disappointed\u201d by the designation of Montanas as an independent company, but is hopeful the company would be able to flourish under the new law.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about time,\u201d Berman said. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of an insurance policy that anyone else won\u2019t get to keep the good guy and protect the bad guy.\u201d\n"], "gensraw_article": [[14386, 12, 5576, 15992, 961, 4343, 448, 248, 83, 263, 4930, 26, 4620, 288, 1947, 12, 5576, 15992, 12, 258, 19604, 13, 3107, 3316, 5728,

(Nick Adams/Reuters) National and local advocates for marijuana policy reform are using a new poll to kick off a major push for the legalization or decriminalization of cannabis in the District one that could include the pursuit of a ballot initiative in 2014. The poll was sponsored by the Marijuana Policy Project, the Drug Policy Alliance and financed by Dr. Bronners Magic Soaps, a company that had backed legalization referendums in four states. Public Policy Polling conducted the automated telephone poll on April 10 and 11, reaching 1,621 registered voters. It showed two-thirds of D.C. registered voters would at least partially support a legalization referendum similar to the ones passed last year in Colorado and Washington state. Three-quarters of poll respondents favored the decriminalization approach adopted by several states and municipalities, which would turn the possession of small amounts of marijuana from a criminal offense to something more akin to a traffic ticket. A January 2010 XXX survey found residents more closely split when asked whether they favored legalizing the possession of marijuana for personal use, with 46 percent in favor to 48 percent opposed. The XXX poll, which carried a three-point margin of error, showed white residents were much more likely to favor legalization (60-35) than black residents (37-55). The new poll, which did not report a margin of error, found a racial disparity, but a less dramatic one. Both white and black residents favored Colorado/Washington-style legalization, though by different degrees 77-19 for whites, 53-38 for blacks. Same goes for the decriminalization question, which was supported by 85 percent of white residents and 69 percent of black residents. There is evidence that national attitudes on marijuana policy have changed in recent years. A Pew Research Center poll released earlier this month found a majority of Americans favored legalization , marking a dramatic shift from even a decade ago, when closer to two-thirds of national poll respondents opposed legalization. Adam Eidinger, a longtime local activist who is employed by Dr. Bronners, said the time has come for city leaders to change District law to reflect popular opinion.Its a popular issue, and up until now the council has ignored it, he said. Maybe now theyll realize the citizens want to to decriminalize at the very least. Officials with the Marijuana Policy Project and Drug Policy Alliance said they will be lobbying the D.C. Council in the coming months to pursue legislative changes. Mason Tvert, MPPs communications director, said his group will be talking to community leaders and elected officials about various options for adopting a more sensible marijuana policy in the District.Bill Piper, director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, said decriminalization would be a no-brainer but legislators should do more. There is an opportunity to make a clean break from the past and treat drug use as a health issue instead of a criminal justice issue, Piper said. The new push comes just as the citys first medical marijuana dispensary is set to open . But city legislators, most notably Council Chairman Phil Mendelson, have been wary of pursuing wide scale decriminalization or legalization or even a more liberal medical marijuana regimeciting the likelihood that federal marijuana laws will remain in effect and the potential response from the citys congressional overseers. There is a good argument for decriminalizing a drug that is widely used and that results in a lot of arrest records and not having an effect on violent crime, Mendelson said in December , but I dont think this is the time for the District to be discussing that. Eidinger said Tuesday that he is prepared to mount a ballot initiative should the council fail to act. He has founded DCMJ a skeleton organization consisting, he says, basically me and a few other people in the city who are interested in advancing the issue. The idea is that we need to create a grassroots organization in the city that is going to advance this ballot initiative if we have to do it, Eidinger said. Meanwhile, [MPP and DPA] will be accelerating their lobbying. I think its unnecessary if the council does their jobs. Piper, of the Drug Policy Alliance, acknowledged internal and external discussions about doing a ballot measure but our preference is to work with the council on a set of reforms to reduce incarceration, racial disparities, and drug overdoses.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["If you\u2019re still confused on the subject of marijuana policy, here\u2019s a link to a few pro-marijuana nonprofits to track your progress.\nWashington Cannabis Business of D.C. was founded in February.

Sousley told the officers that he had taken THC oil pills, but did not have marijuana. When police officers wanted to search Nolan Sousleys medicine bag, he said no. One of the officers said police had received a call that marijuana could be smelled in the hospital room in Bolivar, in western Missouri where the substance is illegal, though medical marijuana will soon be available in the state. Sousley, who said he has Stage 4 pancreatic cancer, told the officers that he had taken THC oil pills in the parking lot of Citizens Memorial Hospital but that he did not have marijuana and he did not want them going through his things. There is no way they could smell it, doc, because I dont smoke it, Sousley said to a medical professional who was in the room Wednesday during a Facebook Live video . The video was streamed from the page Nolans Tribe of Warriors Against Cancer . I dont ever use a ground-up plant. Its an oil that I use in a capsule. Then he told her about his bag of medication. Im not letting them dig through it. It has my final-day things in there, and nobodys going to dig in it, Sousley said, his voice cracking. Sousley said in a subsequent video that he ultimately let one of the officers go through the bag and that no marijuana was discovered. The video of the search, which has been viewed more than 600,000 times, prompted outcry from people advocating for such oils and for Sousley, who has said that he does not know how long he has to live. The Facebook page for Sousley said he was diagnosed around Memorial Day with pancreatic cancer that had metastasized to his liver. He said he takes THC oil to manage pain. A Facebook post from Thursday talked about the viral response. This is what Ive worked for. It finally got here. Here we go fellow fighters. We goin viral. Im gettin calls from weed companies, attorneys I am crying Im so happy. I can quit workin so hard now, it read. The comment added, I told you I was gonna do this and I did. I want the world to see how we treat our own people. Forget immigration we have criminals laying in the hospital I guess. I am so happy. Look what weve done. All of us together. Thank you all so much for caring and believing. Let it go. Let it grow. Amid the uproar, Sousley told the Bolivar Herald-Free Press that he did not blame the police and hopes the incident can be used for good. Bolivar Police Chief Mark Webb told the Herald-Free Press that officers responded to a call last week about possible marijuana in a patients room at Citizens Memorial Hospital and obtained consent to conduct a search. It is not clear who placed the call. But Sousley told the newspaper that a security guard entered his room, saying he could smell marijuana smoke, then phoned police. The Facebook Live video started after police arrived. In the video, an officer is seen searching bags in Sousleys room. During the search, a woman in a white lab coat, whom Sousley referred to in the video as his doctor, asked the officers, Just from a legal standpoint, do you have probable cause to search his stuff? Do you have the right to search his stuff or do you need a warrant for that? Officers told the doctor that they had the right because it was on private property. So whats the proceeding here? she asked them. Because he needs to be here. The officers explained that if they discovered marijuana, they would give Sousley a citation but would not take him to jail. Soon after, the broadcast ended. Webb, the police chief, told the Herald-Free Press that nothing was found. Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment by XXX. After the incident, Tamera Heitz-Peek, a hospital spokeswoman, said in a statement to XXX that respect is part of our core values and our actions in this recent event did not reflect who we are as an organization. We pride ourselves in providing compassionate care to all patients and we fell short of expectations, she said in the statement Sunday. We apologize to our patient and his family and friends who were affected by our actions. We are reviewing the incident and will retrain our employees in the core values and the importance of respect and dignity to our patients and the community. In November, Missourians voted to legalize medical marijuana for patients with serious illnesses or medical conditions. However, the rules and regulations needed to implement the law may not be in place until the summer, and the substance will not be available for purchase until at least January, according to the states Department of Health and Senior Services . Patients with cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, and chronic or terminal conditions may qualify for treatment. Recreational marijuana is illegal in the state. Webb told the Herald-Free Press that his departments social media account has been overrun with negative comments since the incident. In a statement to the newspaper Saturday, Sousley said that we are all human beings and then called on people to treat everyone the way you want to be treated. It is my desire that this entire situation be used for good politicians should stop trying to limit our right to use cannabis and its derivatives, Sousley said in the statement, which was provided to the newspaper by a lawyer with the same last name as his. There are many issues that are demanding the attention of politicians. This is not one of them. He added that he hopes CMH and the City of Bolivar will train officers to treat everyone with whom they interact with respect and refrain from treating people as if they all belong in jail, regardless of economic status, race, culture, religion.

The bill, which activists describe as a first for the Senate, would end the federal prohibition on medical marijuana and implement a number of critical reforms that advocatesof both medical and recreational marijuana have been seekingfor years, according to several people familiar with thedetails of the proposal . It would reclassifythe drugin the eyes of theDrug Enforcement Administration, allow for limited inter-state transport of certain medicines derived from cannabis, expand access to cannabis for research, and makeit easier for doctors to recommend the drug to veteransandeasier for banks to provide services to the industry. Its the most comprehensivemedical marijuana bill in Congress, said Bill Piper, director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, one of several groupsconsulted for the bill. The Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States (CARERS) Act grew outof an amendment proposed last year by Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.). A number of activist organizations deeply involved with passing medical and recreational marijuana laws at the state level were consulted in drafting the bill, including the Drug Policy Alliance, the Marijuana Policy Project, and Americans for Safe Access. And advocates say they are generally pleased with what theyve seen and heard. It really is a comprehensive billit would effectively end the federal war on medical marijuana, said Tom Angell, chairman of the advocacy group Marijuana Majority. But the bill has its detractors. Dr. Kevin Sabet, president of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana,says that while better research and non-smoked medications are necessary, the bill overreaches. Its like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, he said by e-mail. Why not start work with scientists to incentivize research rather than open the floodgates to Big Marijuana? Most major medical organizations oppose smoked pot as medicine because the risks outweigh any benefits. This bill just isnt supported by the science, plain and simple. The following arefive of the bills key provisions, according to several people familiar withit. Under the bill, marijuana would be downgraded one level in the Drug Enforcement Agencys five-category drug classification system . It is currently treated, along with heroin, LSD, and ecstasy, as a Schedule 1 drugthose deemed by the DEA to have no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.The bill would reclassify it asa Schedule 2 drug, joining cocaine, OxyContin, Adderall and Ritalin. The bill would also make it easier to transport some forms of the drugbetween states. While medical marijuana is allowed in 23 states and D.C., another dozen states allow the drug on a much more limited basis. Those states typically allow restricted access to medicine derived from cannabisstrains with low levels of THC, the drugs primary psychoactive component, and high levels of CBD, which is believed to have medicinal benefits. But patients often have no way of accessing such drugs.Thebill would thereforeremove some CBD strains, used to treat epilepsy and seizure disorders, from the federal definition of marijuana. The bill would also make it easier for bankstoprovide services to the marijuana industry as they do to any other. It would reform theprocess by which private researchers can get access to medical marijuana. And it would allow doctors working for the Department of Veterans Affairs in states where medical marijuana is legal to recommend it for certain conditions. The historic bill represents another in a long string of victories for marijuana advocates, who have seen voters legalize the drug for recreational use in four states since 2012: Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington. Nearly half the states have legalizedmedical marijuana and the public support has been growing, with roughly half the nationsupporting legalization according toseveral polls. The political winds have been shifting, too. Three potential Republican presidential candidatesPaul, Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and former Florida governor Jeb Bushhave come out in support of state legalization laws, though theyve hedged on their personal support of such policies.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["The dreary looks of a 37-year-old House bill set to be laid bare this week represent the culmination of a year and a half of planning and debate, as lawmakers come together on a core policy to define the term \u201cmedical marijuana.\u201d\nMore than 300 lawmakers \u2014 16 of whom are Democrats \u2014 have taken part in a day-long meeting that has descended into debating dozens of technical issues, including the ability to cultivate and deliver marijuana in the state and the potential application of medical marijuana.\nThe House bill is scheduled to go before a full House and Senate floor on Thursday evening. Assuming all goes as scheduled, and most of the details work their way through the bill\u2019s agenda, it is expected to deliver about $70 million in state and local taxes that will be infused to offset some of the lost tax revenue. Lawmakers are betting that a lack of oversight will be part of the playing field that the bill creates for legitimate marijuana businesses.\nWith two months to go until the House starts debate on this year\u2019s marijuana legislation, legislators are racing to decide whether there is enough substance to justify the project\u2019s existence.\nSome lawmakers predict significant changes after the House sends it to the Senate for consideration. It will not be the only bill in the pipeline. Other bills that could come into play include an expanded prescription drug coverage for adults, a state-level presumption that weed will be regulated by Medicare, and voter-approved sales tax changes in states that are experimenting with medical marijuana.\nIt is at this time that lawmakers will decide how they want to proceed.\nWhat\u2019s in the historic medical marijuana bill being unveiled Friday evening?

The bill, to be introduced bySenators Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), would end the federal ban on medical marijuana and implement a series of reforms long sought by advocates. They includedowngrading its status with the Drug Enforcement Agency from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2, allowingdoctors to recommend its use in some cases to veterans, expanding access to researchers and making it easier for banks to provide services to the industry. The Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States (CARERS) Actwouldallow patients, doctors and businesses in states that have already passed medical marijuana laws to participate in those programs without fear of federal prosecution, according to a joint statement from the senators offices. The bill will also make overdue reforms to ensure patients including veterans receiving care from VA facilities in states with medical marijuana programs access the care they need. The proposalwillbe unveiled at a 12:30 p.m. press conference on Tuesday, which will be streamed live here . Patients, their families and advocates will join the senators at the press conference. The announcement was met with praise by advocates. This is a significant step forward when it comes to reforming marijuana laws at the federal level, Dan Riffle, director of federal policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a statement. Its long past time to end the federal ban, said Michael Collins, policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance, said in a statement. Both describe the introduction of the bill as a first for the Senate. Advocates are riding a wave of success in recent years, with voters in four states Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington approving the legalization of the drug for recreational use.The idea has made significant gains in public opinion as well. In December, Congress for the first time in roughly a decade of trying approved an amendment that barsthe Justice Department from using its funds to prevent states from implementing their medical marijuana laws a significant victory for proponents of the practice. Potential Republican presidential candidates Rand, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) have all said they support states rights to legalize pot, though they themselves disagree with the policy. In recent years, several national polls have found majority support for legalizing marijuana. Differences are typically highly split by age the young tend to disproportionately support such policies. Medical marijuana has been approved to varying degrees in 23 states and D.C.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["When the McCain-Lieberman bill comes up for a vote in the Senate, it might not be as easy as it sounds. But it\u2019s relatively difficult, and could have immense consequences for how the medical marijuana industry deals with the future of medical marijuana.\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., has been working with a bipartisan group of senators to try to garner their support for the bill. With the highest bipartisan support in the last two years, he\u2019s hoping to work with Sens. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., to push it to a full vote in the Senate. Blumenthal is writing the legislation and has co-sponsored a version in the past. Feinstein and Blumenthal are also writing additional legislation.\nThe two senators plan to join with Murphy to draft a measure related to federal medical marijuana, according to one person familiar with the plans. They are negotiating with the White House to get behind the bill.\nThere are currently 20 states, including all nine of the states that regulate medical marijuana, that regulate pot possession and/or production.\nThe Hendersons told the Hill this morning that they are looking at ways to craft provisions in the bill that can better protect patients from pain and risk for others, while helping the industry transition to a 21st century medical marijuana system.\nAccording to Ali Briggs, lobbyist for the Marijuana Policy Project, there is a lack of clarity on the rules governing marijuana industry practice or compliance, and that management of the industry needs to be overhauled to bring it up to Medicare standards.\n\u201cThis is a very complex bill,\u201d Briggs told the Washington

But it\u2019s still known for this opiate epidemic of \u201cAmen\u201d overdoes and \u201cGarbage\u201d over-sugar, cocaine, and methamphetamine sales.\nThe practice of removing marijuana from public sidewalks has been legal for decades, but the federal ban on outdoor smoking in public includes it for medical purposes and for recreational marijuana. And when demonstrators pray during a religious ritual, a loam is their prayer window.\nVirginia has become the latest state to ban pot from public sidewalks. Washington lawmakers decided in May that the prohibition was unconstitutional because medical marijuana use was within the scope of the law.\nAccording to the Washington States Attorney\u2019s Office, Washington, state troopers are still removing marijuana from sidewalks: So far this year, nearly 1,000 people have been cited by state troopers for marijuana offenses \u2013 over half of them for the contraband. Three pedestrians are injured, and in a single week, 70 have been cited for marijuana offenses.\nHere are some other takeaways from the latest report on state marijuana laws:\nProhibition\u2014The 1982 State Law\u2019s prohibition on medical marijuana amounted to a permanent prohibition on medical marijuana use by an adult child, pending the conclusion of an ongoing administrative investigation. The Justice Department acknowledged, however, that its inspection program was comprehensive and resulted in a 2004 federal ruling that the process is lawful and reasonable. The Department of Justice re-posted the finding last September, and the case reopened in late May. But while the committee investigating the \u201clegalization\u201d of marijuana said in an early report that the federal law\u2019s prohibition on medical marijuana \u201ccannot be enforced,\u201d that finding appears to be aimed only at determining whether medical marijuana is legal. The committee is now analyzing whether there is a mandate to immediately stop all medical marijuana operations on sidewalks and at public sidewalks. Members say that federal courts have never expressly allowed states to start enforcing the ban, and no federal agency would openly deny the government \u201caffirmed a prohibition on this type of activity.\u201d\nWomen\u2019s Health\u2014While the health department has stopped routine banning of smoking pot in public, women have not been able to obtain legal remedies. That remains the case for pot users (67% since 2006), according to a recent study by the American Bar Association and the American Academy of Radiology, which tracked attitudes about marijuana use in 2005. They all find that they prefer to use marijuana but that they too are addicted to the drug, with 53% reporting that smoking pot has not increased their risk of using a drug.\nIbrugate\u2014The Health Department says the ban in Washington is constitutional, and it\u2019s the District Court\u2019s job to determine whether an existing ban applies to the recreational pot that also has occurred in Virginia. The courts, while denying legal review, have jurisdiction. Doctors are generally unwilling to place patients on public streets unless they have to, and the city planning departments have no authority to do so.\n"], "gensraw_article": [[33, 1030, 13, 438,

In a letter to his fans, the rock legend explained that he had recently applied to become a dual citizen and passed the test for American citizenship, answering honestly to each question. But, Young wrote Friday, he was asked to take another test due to my use of marijuana and how some people who smoke it have exhibited a problem. Young said that problem stems from an April 19 clarification to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services policy that lists the use of marijuana, among other federally controlled substances, as a conditional bar to establishing good moral character. AD Good moral character, or GMC, is a general requirement for U.S. citizenship introduced in 1970 that gauges whether an applicant measures up to the standards of average citizens of the community in which the applicant resides. Even though a number of U.S. states have decriminalized marijuana use for both medicinal and nonmedicinal purposes, the drug remains a controlled substance at the federal level. AD Neil Young takes aim not just at Trump, but Monsanto and Starbucks, too Young, who turns 74 on Tuesday, specifically cited former attorney general Jeff Sessions in his letter, who in 2018 made it easier for U.S. prosecutors to enforce federal marijuana law in states that had legalized the substance. It came as a reversal to an Obama-era policy that discouraged enforcement of the law in states where it was legal. The USCIS says U.S. citizenship applicants involved in certain marijuana related activities may lack GMC if found to have violated federal law, even if such activity is not unlawful under applicable states and foreign laws. AD In a statement, a USCIS spokesperson said the agency could not discuss, confirm or deny information about Youngs case due to privacy protections. The spokesperson reiterated that marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance. AD The District of Columbia and 11 states Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington have adopted laws allowing recreational use of the drug. I sincerely hope I have exhibited good moral character and will be able to vote my conscience on Donald J. Trump and his fellow American candidates, (as yet unnamed), Young wrote on his website. I will keep you posted, but I dont think I will be able to remain parked here during the proceedings. AD In an interview with the Los Angeles Times last month, Young said even though he moved to California in the mid-1960s, the countrys climate crisis is a prevailing reason he wants to become a U.S. citizen now. A known liberal and environmentalist, Young in 2015 asked Trump not to use his song Rockin in the Free World at campaign events. AD Weve got a climate emergency and governments are not acting. Democracy is based on [the principle that] you have a vote, you have a voice, he told the Times . Im still a Canadian. Theres nothing that can take that away from me. But I live down here. I pay taxes down here. My beautiful family is down here. Theyre all Americans. So I want to register my opinion.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["It\u2019s that time of year again. People are anxious to know their citizenship status, and executive Trump scholar Neil Young agrees. \u201cAfter all, as an accountant and professor, I have to file a monthly federal income tax return,\u201d he tells the DC Parenthetical History blog. \u201cI would like to talk about the person \u2026 (that) I voted for the end of slavery!\u201d\nYoung says he was asked to comment at length about marijuana use with his interviewer, but he didn\u2019t want to \u201csend the wrong message,\u201d according to e-mails from the Today show. Young wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that if people are changing their personal background and are not incarcerated, it comes down to a child of law. I am not paying for this. My weed is called \u2018misery\u2019 and I would not ask for any unpaid government help in any way, for any reason.\u201d The comedian says he has used marijuana in the past.\nThe conservative blog Open Secrets reported Wednesday that Young, who recently returned from more than 200 South Asian festivals across the country, has gotten a grace period after getting a Green Card application for his parents\u2019 citizenship. The writer notes that when when his parents gave him their U.S. citizenship in 2007, their it was \u201ctold, among other things, that he had been turned away at border.\u201d\nThe transcript of the interview\u2014which doesn\u2019t reveal how they got the green card\u2014comes after a man whose name has been linked to Young told ET-TV that his father bought his friend into weed years before he left the U.S.\n\u201cBy then, I was 16,\u201d said Terence and Margaret Young, \u201cso when I left, they said I should consider doing drugs because I was too shy.\u201d\nTerence, who died in 2009, told NPR that while he enjoys teaching, it\u2019s in his off hours that he finds time to grow marijuana. \u201cI make all my adult stuff done at home at my house,\u201d he said. \u201cI am constantly teaching myself how to grow pot because I really do love to do that\u2026 I learned a lot when I was younger. I feel like it just works, but growing small amounts\u2026 Getting another five years after I left the country\u2014I come back to work every week, because I\u2019m in charge of marijuana. It\u2019s kind of a (pressure to keep) the house and get money out and to bring back two kids [to the U.S.]\u2026\u201d\nThe application is placed on an official federal database, similar to Social Security and banking records, which includes small numbers of migrants and those born in a country without proper paperwork. Some low-level offenders can, however, receive cash rewards, as the Young home in Virginia describes in its declaration. \u201cTo come here, you have to be an extra-high-level [leveler], not a straight-A student or a stable house borrower,\u201d it says.\nThe Huffington Post is maintaining that Tracey Adams reports Young\u2019s profile on Facebook: \u201cBrian Young is an accountant and non-elected consultant, who leads efforts to preserve the benefits of Social Security. He is outspoken on the work ethic and the American spirit, and is knowledgeable on the subject of poverty and the wage-and-living issue.\u201d\nYoung\u2019s son, Caleb, tells The Wall Street Journal about a policy change brought on by the Post. \u201cWhen people say the worst thing about a guy like Neil Young is that he goes to prison and he doesn\u2019t have to like it, then the truth will come out,\u201d Caleb said.\nRelated: Read the best memoirs of civil rights struggle \u00bb\n"], "gensraw_article": [[1027, 448, 248, 83, 327, 641, 287, 615, 758, 14, 4381, 390, 18117, 285, 761, 512,

Dream Day, we ask our favorite people in the area to tell us how they would spend a perfect day in the District. If D.C. had a Queen of Cannabis, the throne might belong to Brooklands Caroline Phillips, the founder of the National Cannabis Festival . Phillips, a native Washingtonian who runs events company The High Street, started the festival in 2016, after D.C. voters legalized marijuana for recreational use (but not sales). This years festival appropriately falls on April 20 and features music from Ludacris and Action Bronson (RFK Festival Grounds; Sat., noon-8 p.m., $55). Because this is D.C., the festival will also host a policy summit Friday at The Newseum. Its great to see the D.C. area become a destination for people interested in cannabis recreationally but also cannabis policy, says Phillips, 38. Recreational marijuana sales would officially be legal on her dream day, and, since the festival itself was once just a pipe dream, her itinerary would lead there. I would meet up with Brau Runners thats my running team. We do a lot of Ragnar relays along with charity races. We always start at a bar and end at a bar, so wed start at Brooklands Finest . Our run would take us down Rhode Island Avenue NE. Theres a pretty gnarly hill there, but once you get to the top, you feel really good about yourself. Wed hang right on Florida Avenue NW and stop and idle in front of the MetroPCS store to soak in some D.C. go-go music. AD AD We would head back to Brooklands Finest, my favorite place for brunch. They always have a special waffle that has some kind of fruit compote and whipped cream. You cant really go wrong with that. Im going to hop back to my house and grab my dogs two little mutts and significant other. We would go by one of D.C.s dispensaries and pick something up for the day that could be used in a vape pen. Id like to stop by Union Market . First I would stop at DC Dosa . Usually I just point to things I dont have a thing I normally get there. Then I would go to Trickling Springs Creamery for a milkshake. Were walking and as we round a turn, I [spot] the whole National Cannabis Festival team. We all end up walking together down H Street NE. AD I like Congressional Cemetery for a good dog walk. Theres this bench on top of the hill. Underneath it theres this little compartment and theres a notebook inside. Everybody can open it up and leave a message. Whenever I go there, I sit down for a bit and just read through the different stories. Im pretty sure I left a note in there around 2015 when I started thinking about the festival. AD Were heading over to the festival grounds. Everything is just happening: Wonderful festival fairies are dropping everything into position. To get there, were going to pass the D.C. Central Detention Facility . This is a weird part of my dream day, but I do think its important for people to understand that there are people in jail for trying to pay their bills with weed, while there are now states that are paying their bills with weed money. I would take a moment to really think about the people who have been jailed for drug offenses. At the festival, the first stop is the advocacy village. Wed probably fan out from there and, finally, all gather together in front of the stage for Ludacris.", "summary": null, "top_ps": [0.949999988079071], "gens_article": ["D.C. Cannabis Caf\u00e9 founder Caroline Phillips, born Amy Shellhorn, raised in Vermont, gets her culinary beginnings helping the local dispensary at the 2013 National Cannabis Festival.\nShe's gotten started in D.C.\u2019s cannabis industry as well, with the founding of her first restaurant, I.C. in Greenwich Village in 1998. In 2009 she ran her first independent caf\u00e9 in Guernsey Street, making her the namesake of that summer\u2019s original Food & Wine magazine.\nBut she quickly discovered there\u2019s a unique way to gain access to Washington\u2019s cannabis industry. She\u2019s known for cooking up delicious coffee at her caf\u00e9, from low-sugar pretzels to toothpaste to lemonade.\n\u201cMy dad\u2019s producing corn and that corn has 60 grams of THC in it,\u201d Phillips says. \u201cMy mom\u2019s producing a lot of corn and also I have to support the production of corn. I was born in Vermont but all the barista girls in this new town aren\u2019t doing that.\u201d\nPhillips met her husband, Virginia Phillips, a native of Washington, when she visited her son, Damon.\n\u201cWe were talking about the interesting things that Washington is, so he said to me, \u2018People who are trying to get a foothold for marijuana have an advantage \u2013 they can get away with it, they can all make a living from their money,\u2019\u201d Phillips says. \u201cI said I\u2019d meet up with him and to start shooting a business.\u201d\nNow she serves as a co-founder of Five Cigg, which sells the marijuana concentrates at its Cumberland Street, District location. Along with her husband, Jason Phillips, Phillips is a former storyteller for NPR\u2019s NPR and White House reporters.\nPhillips credits her training with her fledgling business.\n\u201cYou spend a lot of time training people who are good cooks,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the federal trial, it was starting people where we would think we were coming up with the best stuff from scratch. In Denver, it\u2019s starting people\u2019s food when we were creating the whole thing.\u201d\nVenerable food is top of the list, but Matt Tinos, a beermaker who\u2019s run eight distilleries in Washington for 40 years, is a stickler for respecting the plant.\n\u201cThink about it, we had 21 people in the room already working,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all learned 10 years ago, no one knew what to do with hemp!\u201d\nThe only weed in Washington\nSarah Hassan is a Washingtonian.
