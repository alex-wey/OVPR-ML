This is a good idea ##BASIC STATE
 if you wanted to try it ; ##BASIC STATE
 you could call this a fact . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
If you wanted to argue ##BASIC STATE
"I think ##BASIC STATE
 legalization of pot is bad , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 CMV " , ##IMPERATIVE
 you could have done that , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and it would be a completely different debate . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Instead , ##OTHER
you went with a title ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that basically insinuates ##BASIC STATE
 that legalization advocates are either addicts or dealers. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
I think ##BASIC STATE
 that specific argument has been disproven , ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and you 've acknowledged as much . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Even here , ##OTHER
substance abuse is very different from addiction. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Using 'analytical evidence' ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 That made for pretty good fodder in my earlier post , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 but that does n't always work . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
That makes for a problem ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 if you want to add the relevant bit of evidence ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //3
 but , ##OTHER
in my opinion , ##OTHER
 just is n't strong enough . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
For example , ##OTHER
 I had a problem with multiple forms of mass adoption of cannabidiol . ##BASIC STATE
I was told ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that it was the most common meth tablet ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and that since it was banned , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 it was easier for those ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 seeking the word ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 'kid' to make a prescription ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
 than it was for actual abuse . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //4
Having argued ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 that proper use of illicit cannabis , ##OTHER
 as opposed to 'drug use' ##OTHER
 would be the death of the user , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) 
 I was going to argue ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 that one component of child abuse is the manufacture of illegal painkillers , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL) //4
 but instead I 'd argue ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 that people ##OTHER
 who inhale and administer pain medications ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 tend to remain addicts ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 and , ##OTHER
as a result , ##OTHER
tend to be less likely to become foster parents or doctors ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 ( blame the teen snoopers for this , okay ? ) . ##IMPERATIVE
Both of these arguments are vague enough , ##BASIC STATE
 but now add a 'public awareness campaign' ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //3
 and you get a shift . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //3
I 'd say ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 that there 's always 'an awareness campaign' ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 and people realise ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 who they really are . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Now : part 2 ##OTHER
The question as to whether legalization should be watered down : ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 which one is better ? ##QUESTION
Is the social benefits of legalization worth the risk of being addicted , ##QUESTION
or is the most vulnerable population in the society responsible for the abuse of drugs ? ##QUESTION
And what changes would you make ##QUESTION
 if you felt ##BASIC STATE
 that the law was too broad ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
I do n't know ##BASIC STATE
 whether I 'd necessarily have to decide between : ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 do we want legalization here or , ##QUESTION
more broadly , ##OTHER
do we want the new kid on the block to be the next in a long line of first-time legalization users . ##QUESTION
The other question ##OTHER
 you raised in my earlier post is whether someone should be able to see a legal version of marijuana ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 but still be treated as a street drug . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
I do n't see ##BASIC STATE
 that this should be equivalent to alcohol or cocaine or prescription medication . ##BASIC STATE //4
You would still be able to purchase the stuff anyway , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 but I do n't think ##BASIC STATE
 that it 's particularly important ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that someone be able to take ( presumably ) the stuff , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 so that they would n't feel ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 like they have a good idea about how it 's actually used . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
However , ##OTHER
did you go with this title ? ##QUESTION
