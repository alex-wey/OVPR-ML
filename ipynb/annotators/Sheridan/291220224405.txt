Can I throw my thoughts in here ? ##QUESTION
Thanks guys . ##OTHER
I enjoy GJ 's stance on medical Cannabis . ##BASIC STATE
But almost everything else , ##OTHER
 I do n't agree with . ##BASIC STATE
So it 's hard to vote for a man ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 who I disagree with 9/10 times . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (HABITUAL) //4
But let 's look at BO from another point . ##IMPERATIVE //4
He has called for a few DEA raids on dispensaries , ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 yes , ##OTHER
this is true . ##BASIC STATE
But this is an election year , ##BASIC STATE
 and he is more concerned with getting reelected . ##BASIC STATE
So if he knows ##BASIC STATE
 that he needs to call for a few raids , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and not push for decriminalization ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 in order to gain a few moderate Repub voters , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 or swing voters ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
 ( not sure of the exact term here ) ; ##OTHER
 he 's going to do that . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Long story short , ##OTHER
 I think ##BASIC STATE
 he 's taking it easy . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
No use shooting himself in the foot . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //4
Now let 's look at the next four years , ##IMPERATIVE //4
 supposing BO wins . ##OTHER //3
He cannot be reelected , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 so I think ##BASIC STATE
 there 's a MUCH bigger chance ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //4
 for him to go along with decrim measures , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
and legalization issues . ##OTHER
He 's younger , ##BASIC STATE
 he was a smoker , ##BASIC STATE
 and he knows people care about the issue . ##BASIC STATE
The man is n't dumb , ##BASIC STATE
 he knows ##BASIC STATE
 how popular legalization is . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
But in his first term , ##OTHER
 and in an election year , ##OTHER
 he wo n't risk losing it ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 by implementing those things . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Let 's get BO back in office for another 4 years , ##IMPERATIVE
 and see ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 if we can get something out of him . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
With less pressure to get back in office , ##OTHER
 I would be EXTREMELY surprised ##BASIC STATE
 if he did n't take the first major steps towards decriminalization or legalization . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
He has a better shot of winning than Johnson , ##BASIC STATE
 and Obama seems to be ahead of Romney . ##BASIC STATE
Also , ##OTHER
do n't be dumb stoners . ##IMPERATIVE
Go out ##IMPERATIVE
 and vote . ##IMPERATIVE
I just got my application for absentee ballet while at school . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
I hope others follow through as well . : ) ##BASIC STATE
