Does this mean ##BASIC STATE //4
 that the DEA boss has opinions about marijuana the way ##BASIC STATE
 the mayor ##OTHER
 will think about that! ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)*
then ban a dispensary ? ##QUESTION
I 'm not sure ##BASIC STATE
 how he got there . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Before regulating dispensaries , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
most states and cities legalized recreational marijuana ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 and created some form of legal adult use for the majority of their citizens . ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
When you consider the scope of this ( legal ) , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //3
 he 's probably right about states and cities . ##BASIC STATE
But ##OTHER
 if it is true that an intervention by the DEA on peoples behalf would get marijuana smokers hooked , ##BASIC STATE
 that likely gets people off the fence . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
Despite the word tough ##OTHER
 being used ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 to describe some of those people , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 I do n't particularly like the term . ##BASIC STATE
The DEA 's most virulent attack against crime generally results in a department head ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)*
 who writes letters to publicly ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and sings songs about the impact of legalization . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
I like hearing the FBI use the word " career criminal " ##BASIC STATE
 to describe the most successful narcotic drug smuggler in history . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
And the DEA , ##OTHER
 with its second-highest ranking , ##OTHER
 should appreciate ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 what the Trumpian middle class ##OTHER
 ( and its most successful advocate ) ##OTHER
 have to say about the criminality of others . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Fiction has always played a great role in my daily life . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
I guess ##BASIC STATE
 they have to do so in different areas . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
But my life as an alcoholic-tired driver made me think of a fake freewheeling , high-explosive , religion-tinged writer ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)*
 who I never really related to . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Is it still relevant , ##QUESTION
anyway ? ##QUESTION
But is celebrity celebrity really the antidote to what the DEA is likely to do ? ##QUESTION*
Recent studies have shown ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 that people ##OTHER
 who have made a career of snorting cocaine ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 but who have little to no interest in pot ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 are about one in 4 times more likely to engage in cocaine use . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Can you guess the reason for this or do you think ##QUESTION
 it 's because of the false " iconic " effect ##BASIC STATE 
 celebrities create in a pro-obstacle climate ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
We know ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 there is no such thing as " domestic violence" in the US , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 but about two-thirds of people ##OTHER
 that kill a dog in the US does n't kill a human . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Of course the DEA thought about peoples interdictions with dangerous marijuana . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
But it has n't noticed ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 that people almost always live in jails ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 rather than in prisons . ##OTHER
Its advice to patients , ##OTHER
such as those ##OTHER
 complaining of drowsiness , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 is put down to the suggestion ##BASIC STATE
 that they can run away ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and hurt others ignoring the fact ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 that , ##OTHER
statistically , ##OTHER
a slight increase in serious substance use helps drive people to crime . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Finally , ##OTHER
 what happens ##QUESTION
 when one is young and using cannabis ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 to make ends meet ? ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
The DEA of late knows best . ##BASIC STATE
It 's tough to say ##BASIC STATE
 but the DEA is notorious for stressing it to its young and different people ##BASIC STATE
 that it needs to be closer to the prisons ##BASIC STATE*
 it sweeps through . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Or ##OTHER
 if it 's more extensive , ##BASIC STATE //2
 it 's difficult to discern . ##BASIC STATE //2
