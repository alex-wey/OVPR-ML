Its almost a guarantee ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that you will get prostate cancer ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 by marijuana use , ##OTHER
 and its likely that many users will also decide to smoke marijuana at some point in their lives ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 ( see video above ) . ##IMPERATIVE
Most physicians across the country strongly support legalizing marijuana for medical use and the opportunity to try marijuana itself . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
However , ##OTHER
we cannot rule out the possibility ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 that some individuals prefer to smoke marijuana at some point in their lives . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
According to the David Brennan Center , ##BASIC STATE
among more than half of those ##OTHER
 polled ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 who support legalizing marijuana , ##BASIC STATE
 Less than half of respondents choose cannabis as a safe choice for several uses of the drug , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 including sexual intercourse . ##BASIC STATE //3
This apparently conservative figure is considerably less than half of those ##BASIC STATE
 who support legalizing marijuana use , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and more than half of those ##OTHER
 who dont . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Well , ##OTHER
no one is 100 percent going to get prostate cancer . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
However , ##OTHER
what the same poll found ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 is that nearly 60 percent of those ##OTHER
 polled say ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 they use cannabis for pain management and a growing body of evidence ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that marijuana has helped to reduce chronic pain ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and reduce incontinence , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
among others . ##OTHER
The numbers are staggering . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
In fact , ##OTHER
the UC Davis Medical Society conducted a study ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 50 percent of the majority of users from a medical marijuana clinic ##OTHER
 chose marijuana as a safe choice ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 to relieve pain , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 reduce headaches , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 reduce episodes of chronic bladder or urethra dysfunction , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
as well as lower risk of cancer . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Particularly noteworthy for researchers was a survey ##BASIC STATE
 found by the American Association of University Physicians to find ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)*
 that the percentage of those ##OTHER
 surveyed ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 who said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 they use marijuana as a safe choice ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 to relieve fatigue and pain , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
or an appropriate use of marijuana for a chronic pain solutiona search for i.e. , ##NONSENSE
 why may your body work out , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)*
 if marijuana helps it to relax , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 what happens ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 when you dont get out of bed as easily ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 as before and dont want to use it as often as you used to ? was way way too low . ##NONSENSE
It turns out ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //2
 that marijuana just isnt very effective at relieving pain or urinary symptoms . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
And it isnt all that effective for the poor , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 making it more expensive . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
In fact , ##OTHER
a decade ago doctors recommended ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 that regular treatments for minor pain and urinary symptom relief such ##OTHER
 as antidepressants , acupuncture , and supplements be reserved for people with numerous chronic diseases . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
So the pediatricians of the American Academy of Pediatrics likely recommend only moderate to heavy marijuana use and not considered alternative treatment options , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 making the vast majority of users say ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 they just wouldnt give up the tried and true . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Still , ##OTHER
 a growing number of physicians are increasingly concerned about the potential ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 for doctors to prescribe marijuana as an effective alternative to pain medications . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
The National Institute on Drug Abuse released a report last year ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that 65 percent of patients ##OTHER
 who receive medical marijuana ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 use its extremely limited safety and effectiveness , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 compared to only 19 percent of drug users . ##BASIC STATE
According to a 2013 study by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ##BASIC STATE
 ( SAMHSA ) , ##OTHER
 among 70 million adults worldwide , ##OTHER
medical marijuana may be the safest and most effective approach ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 for treating treatment of chronic conditions and other mental health conditions . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)*
The study also found ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that 38 percent of the people with primary chronic pain may attempt marijuana , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 but they may develop short-term pain ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and difficulty concentrating and expressing emotions , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //2
 according to a 2014 SAMHSA report . ##BASIC STATE
Its a simple solution ##BASIC STATE
 that could save even more lives , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 it seems , ##BASIC STATE
 if it is legalized , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 according to pollster Dave Sonnenberg . ##BASIC STATE
This isnt going to be dealt with in terms of using the drug as a cure . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
There are three major dangers ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 the legalization of marijuana poses , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 which is that its unsafe for medical purposes , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 he told LiveScience . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
If its legalized , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 there will be very limited access to marijuana . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Sonnenberg added ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that its highly likely that , ##BASIC STATE
in the end , ##OTHER
 marijuana is one of the primary drugs ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 used in treating depression and other mental health conditions . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
For most of our patients , ##OTHER
 they have no doubt ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that they will get better , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 he told LiveScience . ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Were now talking about treating a devastating population of depressed individuals ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 that , ##OTHER
 we know , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 will be dead by the time its legalized . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
So , ##OTHER
 once you have a marijuana product thats safe for use , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 maybe that will lead to better care for them . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //4
But in the meantime , ##OTHER
 we have to re-evaluate our own prescribing practices . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
