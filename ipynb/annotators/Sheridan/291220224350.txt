It 's the latest in a series of journalists ##BASIC STATE
 who have found , ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 to varying degrees , ##OTHER
 that Obama did n't smoke weed , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and that sometimes cigars in public were actually part of the ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 and , ##OTHER
unsurprisingly , ##OTHER
were glorified drug treatment . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
It was n't that he did n't ##BASIC STATE //4
 or was n't seriously ill , ##BASIC STATE
 but he did smoke weed , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 he did smoke in public , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 the media were complicit in the story for years , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and nobody treated him ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 like he was recovering , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 although it is true ##BASIC STATE
 he did smoke smoke ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)*
 but there is a huge link between his act of treatment and his crime in the United States . ##BASIC STATE
In 2011 Barack Obama was caught with his second-hand amphetamine and manslaughter of his stepdaughter in front of firefighters at a church . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
So now the same people ##OTHER
 that are going crazy about Obama after this , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
I totally agree . ##BASIC STATE
And the fact ##OTHER
 that marijuana , ##OTHER
and eugenics in general and the same kind of thing , ##OTHER
were passed down to Blacks a thousand years ago is unacceptable . ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Yet we still celebrate no smoking in public . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
The burden of proof ##OTHER
 and distrust with regard to his policies is gigantic . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //4
The Barack Obama I was to view as the great Kim Dohman ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)* //4
 who I hated ##BASIC STATE
 when I saw it in the New York Times , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 with great approval ##OTHER
 he has since then ##OTHER*
 because , ##OTHER
 as an intellectual one ##OTHER
 I wanted to live his life ##BASIC STATE
 like ##OTHER
 he is now , ##BASIC STATE
 I knew ##BASIC STATE
 he had struck a chord in that time , ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
in his relations with Blacks , ##OTHER
in his society and in the gay community , ##OTHER
 as they saw any future president or Democrat . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
That 's what Obama did . ##BASIC STATE
Except , ##OTHER
 since it was East Germany , ##BASIC STATE
 he got an Oscar for that . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Now when the first marijuana bombshell was about Obama ##BASIC STATE //2
 killing his stepdaughter , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 I went back ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 and studied up on him , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
the same man ##OTHER
 who had promised George W. Bush ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 he would smoke cigars ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 while the President was on the radio , ##BASIC STATE
and the same man ##OTHER
 who then was only hinting ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that his country might be put up against a tough new drugs policy , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and in the run up to a new election . ##OTHER
So , ##OTHER
on both counts , ##OTHER
 I hated him . ##BASIC STATE
And I did n't love him either . ##BASIC STATE
I , ##OTHER
like all of you , ##OTHER
 do n't want to pile on that fact , ##BASIC STATE
 that ##OTHER
 maybe he made a mistake ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 because he was just a prime mover in what the Democrats had decided ##BASIC STATE
 that was going to be the most terrible time ##BASIC STATE*
 in human history ##OTHER
 and ##OTHER
 now the Republicans are as depressing as ever , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and Obama 's loose-paddle seems to be a greater deal , ##BASIC STATE
 which means more risk than reward . ##BASIC STATE
David Letterman is a dead man walking . ##BASIC STATE
Even the President 's political career has been sort of exhausted , ##BASIC STATE
 and his attention has fizzled out . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
So perhaps his demise would be worse . ##BASIC STATE
But a more likely explanation would be that it is Obama ##BASIC STATE
 we now see as the strongest symbol of America . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
