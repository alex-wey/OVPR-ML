Most of these are totally different points , ##BASIC STATE
though . ##OTHER
If you wanted to argue ##BASIC STATE
"I think ##BASIC STATE
 legalization of pot is bad , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 CMV " , ##IMPERATIVE
 you could have done that , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and it would be a completely different debate . ##BASIC STATE
Instead , ##OTHER
you went with a title ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that basically insinuates ##BASIC STATE
 that legalization advocates are either addicts or dealers . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
I think ##BASIC STATE
 that specific argument has been disproven , ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and you 've acknowledged as much . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Even here , ##OTHER
substance abuse is very different from addiction. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
most college kids abuse alcohol at some point , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 but only a small percent are alcoholics ) . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The benefits vs costs of marijuana , pot subculture , health effects , etc. have nothing to do with the stated topic of this CMV , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 which is a presumption about the nature of advocates . ##BASIC STATE
The one thing ##OTHER
 you do say ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that is relevant ##BASIC STATE
 ( "most people ##OTHER
 who smoke ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 are involved in a lifestyle ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that revolves ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 around it " ) ##OTHER
 requires some pretty strong statistical support ##BASIC STATE
 to back up ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
 and actually flies in the face of stated evidence . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The number of people ##OTHER
 who support legalization ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 is dramatically higher than the number of people ##BASIC STATE //4
 who are regularly involved in the stoner lifestyle . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
I 'm not trying to convince you ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 that you should support legalization , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 because that 's not what this CMV is about ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 ( and that is a much , much more difficult point to argue ) . ##BASIC STATE
I 'm trying to convince you ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that by assuming ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 legalization advocates are either addicts or dealers , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 you 're making a huge and measurably false presumption . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Nothing more , ##OTHER
nothing less . ##OTHER
