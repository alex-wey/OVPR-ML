muscular dystrophy patient , ##OTHER
 whatever you want to call him ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
First off , ##OTHER
 this is a * man * ##BASIC STATE
 who has gone his entire life ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 never being able to develop substantial muscle mass , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
and unless science intervenes , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 he is going to have to spend the rest of his days ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 with his body consuming itself ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //4
 until he dies a painful death . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
He 's a man , ##BASIC STATE
a human being , ##OTHER
 and that 's how you should think of him. ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
> is at best completely indifferent to and at worst detrimental to the cause of legalization . ##BASIC STATE
You 're making a pretty large conclusion ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 based on a little bit of information . ##BASIC STATE
This man is going out ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 and getting candidates ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 * on film * ##OTHER
 stating their opinions ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 specifically on the issue of medical marijuana , ##OTHER
 for everyone to see . ##OTHER
That is incredibly helpful on one front to the case ##BASIC STATE
 for legalization for medicinal purposes . ##OTHER
Any medical marijuana activist can tell you ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 that most conservatives love to sideline the debate on medical marijuana... ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 bringing up the availability of drugs like marinol , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 the larger " slippery slope " argument of what federal medical marijuana legalization will do ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
(" Uh... ##OTHER
 we 'll then have to legalize marijuana for everybody ! ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Then we 'll have to legalize all drugs ! ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Then all of our children will become raging dope addicts ! " etc ) ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 so in order to cut short that argument ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 before it can even start , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 I would n't be surprised ##BASIC STATE
 if this man was only saying ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 that to keep the conversation focus on the issue of medicinal legalization in the very short space of time ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)*
 that he had . ##BASIC STATE
And given the ambiguity of his statement , ##OTHER
 who is to say ##QUESTION
 he does n't feel ##BASIC STATE
 it should be illegal for children ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 but not consented adults ? ##OTHER
Have you spoken with him directly ? ##QUESTION 
> I certainly would rather see people like him ##BASIC STATE
 ( although not him in particular ) ##OTHER
 be able to use ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 whatever medication they need to relieve their symptoms ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //3
 before I 'd like to see legalization . ##BASIC STATE
Somebody * may * not agree exactly with you on * part * of marijuana policy , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 so you think ##BASIC STATE
 it 's okay ##BASIC STATE
 for them to spend the rest of their life in agonizing pain ? ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Does it not strike you ##QUESTION
 that that sentiment is just as extremist and thoughtless as some of the opinions ##BASIC STATE
 held by anti-drug activists ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
You do n't know this guy , ##BASIC STATE
 nor what he 's been through , ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and you do a disservice to everyone in the legalization movement ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 by resorting to disrespectful name-calling of a hurting individual ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that you disagree with . ##BASIC STATE
