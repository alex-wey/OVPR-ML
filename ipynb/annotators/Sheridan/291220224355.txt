But you are n't being objective here . ##BASIC STATE
You are still making a subjective judgment ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 based on notions ##BASIC STATE
 defined by your cultural experience . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //3
Calling people "suppressed " or " mistreated " shows ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that you are being subjective , ##BASIC STATE
 because other people literally do not see ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 what they are doing as " mistreating ". ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 When you judge a murderer in a court of law , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 you are only being objective within the constraints of the law , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and analysing a case ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 as it relates to the laws in place. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
*The laws themselves are based on subjective ideologies.* ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Example : ##OTHER
 Let 's say ##IMPERATIVE
 a guy gets arrested for having a lot of weed . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
It 's illegal to possess marijuana , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and you 're a judge . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
You disagree with the law , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 but because you are a judge , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 you have to " remain objective " ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and sentence the guy ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 based on the evidence ##BASIC STATE
 that he has a giant bag of weed . ##BASIC STATE
Is the judge really being objective ? ##QUESTION
Only in the context of "obeying the law." ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 I tried to get at this in another comment , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 but are you saying ##QUESTION
 that we are all " bound " to a universal law ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that falls in line with your concept of morality ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
That 's the only possible way ##BASIC STATE
 that everyone in the world could " objectively " say ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 that female circumcision / outlawing homosexuality / etc are " wrong ". ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 We would need to be constrained by a set of undeniable principles to adhere to . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
And I would argue ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 that no such thing actually exists . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
