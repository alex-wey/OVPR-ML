Medical marijuana usage is a hot topic today , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 but many of the politics behind regulation center around biased statistics . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
With various studies and exaggerated opinions , ##OTHER
 it is hard to determine ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 what is true ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and what is utter bologna . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
I might not hold all the answers ##BASIC STATE
 and have always been indifferent on the topic , ##BASIC STATE
 but I do have some insight ##BASIC STATE
 when it comes to positive experiences . ##OTHER
One of my cousins had just graduated from an academy and , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
aside from myself ##OTHER
 and my weakening grandpa , ##OTHER
all my family went out of state for the ceremony . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
My grandma asked ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 if I could check on my grandpa ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 while she was away . ##BASIC STATE
Reluctantly , ##OTHER
I agreed to check on my grandpa ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 to ease her worry . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
My grandpa , ##OTHER
 though I loved him , ##BASIC STATE
 became a difficult person to be around . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
His old age and constant pain turned him into a grump , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 and he felt the need to tell others about his never-ending pain . ##BASIC STATE
It was not exactly a visit ##BASIC STATE
 I was looking forward too . ##BASIC STATE
His agitated state became overbearing . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
People slowly distanced themselves from him , ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 annoyed with his constant negativity . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
I , ##OTHER
like most of my family members , ##OTHER
 took part in the distancing . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Pretending everything was fine was easier , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and remembering him as an active gardener was better than looking at the shell of himself ##BASIC STATE
 he had become . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
But something had changed ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and I suddenly found ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 myself face to face with a familiar stranger . ##OTHER
Armed with a few subs for lunch and my two dogs , ##BASIC STATE
 I slipped into the house ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 and found my grandpa watching reruns of Walker Texas Ranger . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Happy ##OTHER
 I was there , ##BASIC STATE
 he struggled out of his brown recliner ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 to hug me . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
When he noticed my puppies ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 wagging their excited little poodle tails , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 he smiled . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
It had been a long time ##BASIC STATE
 since that smile made an appearance , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 and the gesture warmed my heart . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //4
We made our way to the dining room table ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 so I could put on his pain patch ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and we could eat . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
With only the sound of chewing breaking the silence , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 I began feeling awkward and desperate for a safe conversation topic . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Searching my surroundings ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 as if they held all the answers , ##BASIC STATE
 I began looking for a flare of inspiration . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
My eyes landed on a tiny glass vial ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that contained only about a thimble worth of a crushed plant . ##BASIC STATE
I suddenly remembered my grandma ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 telling me ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 he had recently been prescribed medical marijuana . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Taking the vial as a conversation saver and blessing in disguise , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 I asked him ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 if the medical marijuana had been helping at all . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //4
Not surprisingly , ##OTHER
 he told me no , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 but a smirk curled his lips ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 as he added , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 it gives me one hell of a high , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
though ! ##OTHER
He looked up at me with a glimmer in his eyes ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that had been missing for several years . ##BASIC STATE
The hollows of his face were less prominent , ##BASIC STATE
 his eyes considerably less sunken , ##BASIC STATE
 and an un-pained smile spread across his aged face . ##BASIC STATE
Believing the lively man ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 sitting across from me ##BASIC STATE
 was my grandpa was hard , ##BASIC STATE
 but denying the positive effects of him ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 smiling was impossible . ##BASIC STATE
The conversation sparked , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 and my grandpa proceeded to share with me the how-tos behind smoking . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
I continued to ask questions about the treatment , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 despite knowing very little about marijuana . ##BASIC STATE
This allowed my now enthused grandpa to keep the conversation going . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Wrapped up in the moment , ##BASIC STATE //4
 he asked ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 if I wanted to try it with him . ##BASIC STATE 
He continued by offering to show me ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 how to smoke it from his pipe . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //3
Maybe he didnt realize ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 what he was proposing , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 or he was just proud ##BASIC STATE
 that ##OTHER
 he knew something ##BASIC STATE
 I didnt . ##BASIC STATE
The reason didnt matter ##BASIC STATE
 because it was the most excited ##BASIC STATE
 I had seen him in years . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
I kindly declined his offer ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 but let him describe each step in depth . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
I was a rookie ##BASIC STATE
 that had never smoked , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and I found it far too ironic ##BASIC STATE
 that it was my grandpa of all people to offer me my first puff of marijuana . ##BASIC STATE
I knew ##BASIC STATE
 he wanted me to try it with him , ##BASIC STATE
 he probably thought ##BASIC STATE
 it would be a bonding moment between us , ##BASIC STATE
 but I preferred to remember corn picking and tractor riding as our thing . ##BASIC STATE
While he was telling me about his pipe , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
and the struggle of learning to use it through this foreign thing ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //3
 called YouTube , ##BASIC STATE
 I reflected on how much he had changed . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Though he still was in some pain , ##BASIC STATE
 he was easier to be around . ##BASIC STATE
He discovered a piece of himself ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that was almost lost . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //3
We ended up enjoying our meal , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 and I was happy ##BASIC STATE
 I listened to my grandma . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Watching him feed the dogs ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 lunchmeat made me smile at the magic ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 I had witnessed . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
His new found zest for life could have come from the puppy-love therapy ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 I offered , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //2
 but I believed ##BASIC STATE
 most of his recovery was related to the plant carcass ##BASIC STATE
 he had been smoking . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //3
It wasnt a drug ##BASIC STATE
 meant to get him high , ##BASIC STATE
 and according to him it didnt help much in the pain department , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 but it unexpectedly gave my grandpa some of his lost spark . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
He had some life in him again , ##BASIC STATE
 and I suspected ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //3
 it was a result from the munchies . ##BASIC STATE
His appetite returned , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 and he began moving around more with his returned strength . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //3
If I hadnt witnessed the magic first hand , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 I never would have believed the miracle ##BASIC STATE
 that came from the marijuana . ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
