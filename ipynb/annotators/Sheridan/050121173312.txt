There are tons of questions to be answered about whether people are prone to swallowing marijuana , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 yet new research shows ##BASIC STATE
 that medicinal marijuana is better than simple prescription pain medication . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Lead author Rachel Garvey from Purdue University was reviewing her two studies on newly opened marijuana dispensaries in Washington , D.C. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 When she approached the states marijuana industry , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 she was confronted with a lecture from a manager of a chain of dispensaries ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 who held no official background checks for her . ##BASIC STATE
Garvey and her team used Pulse Strategy , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
a research project ##OTHER
 based at the University of Texas at Austin , ##BASIC STATE
 to examine the hidden risks for weed ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 as it has been legalized in New Mexico , Wisconsin , Indiana , Iowa , Missouri , Nevada , and Minnesota . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
So when she first came across one dispensary , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 she thought about buying medicine cannabis-infused medicine ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that supposedly only harms the heart and soul ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 but soon learned ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that it is an essential ingredient of medical marijuana . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
While pills and cannabis vitamins are claimed ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
 to treat complex conditions like heart and nervous system diseases , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 a dispensary in the West , ##OTHER
 in Utah , ##OTHER
 has marijuana ##BASIC STATE
 that treats different ailments , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 including chronic pain , diabetes , and cancer . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Before further checking the literature , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 Garvey found two surveys in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Both tests turned positive , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 concluding ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that cannabis-based medicines are the least common pain medicine in the United States . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Garvey and her team focused on one dispensary in Columbus , Ohio , as well as one ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that was closed for more than a year ##BASIC STATE
 following drug addiction allegations . ##OTHER
She also looked at another dispensary in Rochester , New York , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that opened July 1 ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 and contracted with Salient Medical ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 to provide cannabis for a normal patient . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Those doctors and others at the threshold of approval ##OTHER
 to prescribe cannabis vaporizers like cannabidiol or air salts , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //1
 and ##OTHER
 she found a 5 percent clearance rate . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)*
Once again , ##OTHER
the technology and experience of dispensaries let Garvey determine ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 why it is that much more common than prescribed medicine in people . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
That leaves an important question unanswered . ##BASIC STATE //3
Are these people the primary beneficiaries of legalized marijuana ? ##QUESTION
Garvey asks . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //3
We began to investigate the medical benefits of our work . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The questions follow this discovery of a secret combination of factors ##BASIC STATE
 that allows marijuana to be used ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 to treat similar conditions ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that people typically do not know about . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
Wake up , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 you open the lid , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 Garvey says . ##BASIC STATE
Thats all ##BASIC STATE //2
 that you have . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL) //3
Researchers then quickly expand the predictive value of cannabis to the apps ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)*
 that allow those services to be used at any given time . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
They ask a third-party lender ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 to check their card history ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 to see ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 if patients ##OTHER
 having an opioid prescription are carrying a marijuana strain or combination of marijuana ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 ( no amount of pills , infused oils , ##OTHER
 and infusion each time ? ) , ##QUESTION*
 and suggest all of those solutions in addition to the newest medical cannabis products . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Its the lowest possible dose , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //3
Garvey says . ##BASIC STATE
Its good . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //3
Garvey hopes ##BASIC STATE
 others can learn about the efficacy of cannabinoid medicine ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 at smaller companies ##OTHER
 so that patients can come into the office ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and experience a better kind of medicine . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
This is a stage of experimentation , ##BASIC STATE
 she says . ##BASIC STATE
People come into the office , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 they get tested at the dispensary or at any dispensary anywhere in the world ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and they see ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 their pain gets better ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and theyre drinking an improved supply of medically essential cannabis something like that . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
Garvey also hopes ##BASIC STATE
 other research companies might include the different ways ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 they can examine these variables . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Its not us pushing it to everyone ##BASIC STATE
 or saying theres the side effect , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 she says . ##BASIC STATE
People get kind of worked up . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
