Drug addiction and mental health are receiving plenty of medical scrutiny lately . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
When dental braces help cut one 's teeth , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 they can improve skeletal health . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Last year Michigan lawmakers approved three treatments : ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 a benign bacterial stench ##OTHER
 that can be deadly on the patient 's teeth ; ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 a perforated bone with a patch ##OTHER
 that can stop popping ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and cause pain ; ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and a new patient 's teeth ##OTHER
 that take up less oxygen . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)*
Seven straight years of new tests will help state medical doctors determine ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 if a patient with a lifelong debilitating condition could be a candidate for drug-free treatment , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 thanks to new research at Michigan State University and Medical School . ##OTHER
Scientists hope ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 these new treatments will prevent the worst cases of medical marijuana abuse . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
" It looks ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 like there 's a real recognition of how serious the problem is , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and where we can impact these people in the future , " ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
said Dr. Marc Ceglia , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
the school 's director of medical marijuana . ##OTHER
Researchers trained 6,000 Kent State University and Michigan State University medical students to analyze the possibility ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 of marijuana " preventing " access to certain classes of medical marijuana . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)*
After analyzing the data , ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 the researchers recruited 6,000 dental patients and 66 doctors ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 who treated 50,000 patients . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Sixteen patients died after being prescribed either prescription drugs or marijuana by their doctors . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Researchers determined ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that drug addicts had more problems ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 -- such as learning to use marijuana less efficiently , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)*
 getting lost , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 or becoming disorientated by the use of painkillers -- ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 than previous patients . ##OTHER
" The clinical research shows ##BASIC STATE //3
 cannabis is no longer a hallucinogenic drug , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and it 's now a once-in-a-lifetime treat , " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Ceglia said . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
In Michigan , ##OTHER
doctors at Ampathe and West Michigan Medical Hospitals were given information from the tests ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 they used to determine ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 whether patients were a potential candidate for potential marijuana use . ##BASIC STATE
The tests showed ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that 24 percent of patients ##OTHER
 -- or 1,378 people -- ##OTHER
 were thinking about getting a marijuana-free hand . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
That put off many more patients ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //4
 who could n't go into a complicated upper body chair , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //4
 which was considered the case for 11 percent of the 51 patients , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //3
or 990 patients . ##OTHER
The study was sponsored by the American Medical Association and the Medical Society of Michigan . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Research on medical marijuana was focused on patients with drug-induced medical conditions ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 who had never been on it ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 -- and thus could n't help it . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
" Using the clinical researchers ' findings , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 we can re-evaluate the intent of medical marijuana laws ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and expand their scope of benefits , " ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
said Dr. Carol Henry , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
a neurologist at University Hospitals and Children 's Hospital ##OTHER
 who was n't involved in the research . ##BASIC STATE
Despite MSA 's vaccine skepticism about medical marijuana , ##OTHER
the group 's estimates were accurate . ##BASIC STATE
" They 've offered treatment ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 that can meet two-thirds of the patients ' needs . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
It makes sense ##BASIC STATE
 that there was one person ##BASIC STATE
 who needed it , ##BASIC STATE
 and it made sense ##BASIC STATE
 that a 10-day treatment could be best ##BASIC STATE
 -- and we did n't have a clear signal , " ##BASIC STATE
Henry said . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
So MSA and the American College of Physicians are leading the way with a collaboration between two Michigan clinics ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that is testing ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 what can be done with marijuana . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
" We 're going to concentrate on the multiple aims . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
We 're going to keep experimenting with new technologies , " ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
said Dr. Susan McMillan , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
a clinician at three ClearPath clinics at St. Charles Hospital in Detroit and Fort Wayne . ##OTHER
Michigan 's most recent update this year excluded all marijuana-free clinical trials , ##BASIC STATE //4
 but McMillan said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 marijuana users could still get a long-term benefit in the face of costs , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
less harm to the patient and less obvious harm to the patients . ##OTHER*
" We 're excited to see ##BASIC STATE
 that the two-thirds reduction , ##OTHER
 which could have been just been dropped now in two , three studies , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 is coming out of a research phase , " ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
McMillan said . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
For patients ##OTHER
 who find themselves constantly stopped from getting a marijuana-free hand , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 experts say ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 there 's a worthwhile role for research . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
" We want to help patients make decisions ##BASIC STATE
 that are responsible for long-term recovery . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
If people are safe from use , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 they 're healthier and more comfortable , " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Ceglia said . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
On Thursday , ##OTHER
supporters will be hearing about the new Kent State case ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 where a patient ##OTHER
 recovering from a medical marijuana overdose ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 is using 1,000 new drugs every day . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Another patient ##OTHER
 whose diagnosis of epilepsy ##OTHER
 has helped her get a course of antibiotics ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 was using too many medications . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
" While it 's important to address the issues ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 about marijuana ##OTHER
 on a patient 's own terms , ##OTHER
 studies like this in Michigan suggest ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 there 's a big difference between general-use and general-use medicine ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
 -- patients should be prepared for the consequences , " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
McMillan said . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
