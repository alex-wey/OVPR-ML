Doug Fines recent piece , ##OTHER
Five myths about legalizing marijuana , ##OTHER //4
 which promotes the legalization of the drug , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
received a lot of attention . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
In his column , ##OTHER
 Fine states five common-sensical assertions ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 regarding marijuana use in our country ##BASIC STATE
 that he wishes werent true , ##BASIC STATE
 labels them as myths , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
and presto , ##OTHER
 concludes ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that legalizing weed will actually help solve a lot of problems . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Oh , ##OTHER
really ? ##QUESTION
Call me old-fashioned , ##IMPERATIVE
 but also call me realistic . ##IMPERATIVE
Advocates of legalizing marijuana are making this debate harder than it has to be . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Simply put : ##OTHER
What current problems of ours might be solved ##QUESTION
 if we had more inebriated people wandering among us ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The first thing pot promoters want us to do is deny the obvious , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 as if we are all stoned . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
They want us to believe ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that the known consequences ##OTHER
 associated with being on the loose with degraded senses in an open society would simply not occur ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 or at the very least , ##OTHER
 would not increase ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 if marijuana use were to become more widespread . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
In Fines case , ##OTHER
myth number one is that , ##BASIC STATE
 If pot is legal , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 more people will use it . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
To rebut that statement , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 Fine cites something or another about drug use in Portugal between the years 2002 and 2006 . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Im not kidding , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 this is the best theyve got . ##BASIC STATE
I dont know ##BASIC STATE
 what it is about modern life in Portugal ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //3
 that we should seek to emulate ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 or why Portuguese drug use should serve as a model for drug use in the United States . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
But , ##OTHER
 you get my point . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Read Fines piece . ##IMPERATIVE
Anyway , ##OTHER
this is an issue ##BASIC STATE
 where Republicans should be clear ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and speak with one voice . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
At a base level , ##OTHER
our politics should seek to promote a more sober , safe and virtuous society , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
and nothing about making pot use more widespread ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
 than it already is serves the common interest . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
I can hear the left rolling their eyes ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 at this quaint notion . ##OTHER
We should not think ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 we can appeal to a segment of voters particularly young voters ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 by embracing destructive misbehavior as desirable public policy . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
