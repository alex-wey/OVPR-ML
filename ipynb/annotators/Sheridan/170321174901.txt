Pot is different from growing , distributing and selling potatoes , beef , salmon or cars , common commodities with of course complex forces at work . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
But cannabis takes complexity to a whole new level , comparable to tobacco and alcohol - ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 which have been among the principal killers of Americans . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Yet the US is ablaze with cannabis : ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //4
 It is our # 1 illicit drug ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and medical marijuana ##OTHER
 ( MJ ) ##OTHER
 is legalized in 29 states and recreational marijuana legal in 8 states ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 ( DC permits both ) . ##BASIC STATE //4
63 % of Americans live in states with medical or recreational MJ or both . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The flame is everywhere and picking up intensity . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Over 22 million Americans ##OTHER
 ( 12 and older ) ##OTHER
 reported using MJ in the past month . ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
While some die-hards may imagine prohibiting the use of ( especially ) ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 recreational marijuana ##OTHER
 and using law enforcement ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 to make that happen ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 that seems an extremely unlikely , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
 not to mention a futile , ##OTHER
 path for this country . ##OTHER
Informed and candid cops know ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that arrest and incarceration cannot solve problems of drug use and dependence . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
So we face questions like : Should cannabis be fully decriminalized ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Should medical and recreational MJ be legalized in all states ? ##QUESTION
Should production and sales be limited ? ##QUESTION
Should the market be allowed its sway ? ##QUESTION
If you as a state feel the heat ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and it is not if but when , ##BASIC STATE
 what design logic would be a useful guide ? ##QUESTION
Will it be individual freedom ##QUESTION
 ( for adults ) , free or regulated markets , or the health of the collective , ##OTHER
 as shaped by public health goals ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //1
Who will benefit therapeutically and financially ? ##QUESTION
Who will suffer ? ##QUESTION
What are the least worst options , given the well-known public health principle ##QUESTION
 that increased access results in greater use ? ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)* //4
These questions are for your consideration as a citizen ##BASIC STATE
 ( and tax payer ) , ##OTHER
 consumer , parent , co-worker , business owner or state or federal official . ##OTHER
We need to shine some light on a poorly lit set of data ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 ( mostly from when MJ was 1/60th as potent ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 as it is today ) ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and experience ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 ( which is not at all uniform or robust from the states ##BASIC STATE* //1
 having gone ahead ) ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 to make decisions now . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
The cannabis fire will rapidly outpace ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 what science and practice may reveal in the years ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 to come . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
To examine ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 what we know ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and what we can do in a clear and sensible way ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 a 3-day , National Cannabis Summit was held in Denver , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 CO , in late August , convened by three organizations . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
It was the brainchild of Neal Shifman , CEO of Advocates for Human Potential , a human services research , consulting and training organization . ##BASIC STATE
He joined forces with The National Council for Behavioral Health , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 constituted of 2900 member mental health and addictions treatment organizations , ##BASIC STATE
 and the Addiction Technology Transfer Center Network , ##OTHER
 which promotes adoption and implementation of what works for people with Substance Use Disorders . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Advocates for Human Potential 2017 National Cannabis Summit The conference smartly assembled a diverse group of government and private stakeholders . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
In practical ways , it crisply reported ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 and discussed state implementation efforts to date , therapeutic effects and health risks of cannabis , legal and clinical knowledge , and the neuroscience of cannabinoids ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 ( the term for the class of diverse chemical compounds ##OTHER
 that act on our brain and body nerve receptors ) . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Here are my take-away messages . ##BASIC STATE
Start small , ##IMPERATIVE
 as a state or county . ##OTHER
Build slowly . ##IMPERATIVE
There is no going back from full recreational legalization , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 especially when for-profit companies are financing its implementation . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Imagine ##IMPERATIVE
 when Anheiser-Busch and RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company start promoting and distributing cannabis . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Remember This Buds For You , The Marlboro Man and Joe Camel ? ##QUESTION
Hence , also ban advertising . ##IMPERATIVE
Separate out the growers from the distributors and those two from the retail sellers . ##IMPERATIVE
Do not permit ##IMPERATIVE
 what is called vertical integration , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 where one entity ##OTHER
 controls the supply chain , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 which can foster monopoly . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Pursue a harm reduction strategy , ##IMPERATIVE
 as Canada is doing nationally under its progressive Prime Minister , Justin Trudeau . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Identify ##IMPERATIVE
 and work to prevent or delay use by pregnant mothers or teenagers , ##IMPERATIVE
 where brains are under development . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL) //3
Add other highly vulnerable populations ##IMPERATIVE
 to that strategy , ##OTHER
 including those with known predispositions to or with family histories of a substance use or mental health disorder . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Dont smoke cannabis . ##IMPERATIVE
Vape or eat it : ##IMPERATIVE
 Smoking is really bad for the lungs . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Decriminalize cannabis . ##IMPERATIVE
Limit access . ##IMPERATIVE
Make the minimal age 21 , ##IMPERATIVE
 set limits of quantities for legal possession and number of home grown plants ##IMPERATIVE
 ( which can become a black / grey market cottage industry ) , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 set limits ##IMPERATIVE
 on dosages because potency counts ##OTHER
 ( e.g. , 10 mg for edibles ) , ##OTHER
 require minimum prices so MJ does not become cheap ( as it has in Washington State ) , ##IMPERATIVE
 and contain production quotas and retail outlets . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Enforce the laws about Driving Under The Influence ##IMPERATIVE
 ( DUI ) ##OTHER 
 and underage sales . ##OTHER
Dont permit public consumption . ##IMPERATIVE
Require childproof packaging . ##IMPERATIVE
Ensure that cannabidiol ##IMPERATIVE
 ( CBD ) ##OTHER
 - the second most common cannabinoid in MJ ##OTHER
 after THC , ##OTHER
 and without psychoactive properties - ##OTHER
 is present in MJ products in significant amounts ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 ( we still dont know ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 what that is ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 but it is not near zero ) ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 because it appears protective against psychosis . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Direct state ( or federal , ##IMPERATIVE
 if that ever happens ) ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //4
 cannabis taxes to fund health insurance , as well as prevention ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 ( especially for youth ) and public information campaigns . ##OTHER
Allocate a percentage of taxes ##IMPERATIVE
 to fund de-identified ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 ( i.e. , privacy protected ) ##OTHER
 state registries ##OTHER
 and use them ##IMPERATIVE
 to evaluate the impact of legalization on health and public safety - both for its therapeutic value and its harm to the brain and body ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 ( including diseases and traffic accidents ) . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //2
Get the FDA to declare cannabis a Schedule 2 drug , not its current hugely deterring Schedule 1 status , ##IMPERATIVE
 so our country can actually study this drug . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //4
Expect over 40 % of current MJ users ##IMPERATIVE
 to ingest 20 or more days / month . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Recognize ##IMPERATIVE
 that the predominance of regular users appears to stop on their own ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)*
 or not use abusively , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 without services ##OTHER
 ( unassisted recovery see Dr. John Kelly , ) . ##IMPERATIVE*
Ensure ##IMPERATIVE
 that those ##OTHER
 who need assistance , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 because cannabis is addictive , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 can access ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and continue in treatments ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 known to work . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Sustain or increase federal funding ##IMPERATIVE
 to study the effects and therapeutic potential of cannabinoids , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 including plant-based THC and CBD as well as the brains own cannabinoid system ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 ( driven by endocannabinoids ) . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
As citizens and policy makers ##OTHER
 we need to lean in to the dilemma of what to do about cannabis . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Silence only lets a vocal minority rule . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Like climate change , ##OTHER
 it is everyones issue , deniers notwithstanding . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
As a friend of mine recently wrote , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 A fool can throw a stone into the water ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 that ten wise men cannot recover . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
( From Jay Neugeboren , March 2017 ) . ##OTHER
In other words , ##OTHER
 there is no single or simple solution to the cannabis Rubic cube . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
We will have to act now , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and sensibly , ##OTHER
 and let science catch up . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
To paraphrase ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 what Churchill said of we Americans , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 we do the right thing ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 after we have exhausted everything else . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Whats ahead is surely difficult ##BASIC STATE
 but it is not impossible . ##BASIC STATE
