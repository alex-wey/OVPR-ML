More than a century ago , ##OTHER
 I wrote an article about California 's constitutional obligation to fight the drug epidemic , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 in which my writing partner asked , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 " Is it really a country 's responsibility ##QUESTION
 to protect its population from the cancer of pot ? " ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
The answer was not . ##BASIC STATE
Let me explain . ##IMPERATIVE
Given the repeated reminders from government doctors , hospitals and their civil liberties activists in California ##OTHER //3
 that a majority of us still believe ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that most illegal drug is " good ," ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
as On the Line and Two Studies put it , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 "Our living standards are deteriorating for people with very high-quality drugs ," ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 the efficacy of the plagues-infested public square has long been doubted . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)*
The populace has still failed to comprehend the true medical benefits of such psychoactive drug abuse . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
But , ##OTHER
 as members of the California State Assembly put it last November , ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 " It is not legitimate for officials ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 who are in the public square to hold themselves accountable for drug abuse . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
It is not their responsibility , ##BASIC STATE //4
which puts them above the law . " ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
Under its law , ##OTHER
the CCC looks after such matters . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
But Forcing law enforcement to confiscate and use drugs against local residents ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 is exactly the kind of way ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 the federal government and courts have barred local marijuana arrests ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and that federal government has retaliated by preventing local governments from conducting drug monitoring programs ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //4
 that enforce federal law . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
In " Raid on Robberies , " ##OTHER
a small Colorado town made a lot less attractive to police by raiding ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)*
 a nearby marijuana grow operation , ##OTHER
 the Journal of State Law and Policy reported ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that the Denver Police Department had actually been investigating successful robberies in the town 's neighborhoods , ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 saying , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 "We were as vigilant ##BASIC STATE
 as we could be ##BASIC STATE
 and we did n't turn up any crack . " ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
The suggestion ##OTHER
 that a local government might be unwilling to protect the people of America from drug-impaired behavior at the expense ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 of local law enforcement ##OTHER
 is deflected by the allegation ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //3
 that federal officials were dragging their feet on drug monitoring in some smaller cities ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 that have since resolved their civil liberties issues ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 with allowing local police to monitor residents ' traffic , home crimes and other activities . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
A prohibition on marijuana in America makes no sense in light of the American very public-private partnership in drugs , prison and background checks ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 for new marijuana sellers , ##OTHER
 which involve public dollars , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 to be directed from a joint of cities and states . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
And with little regard for the accountability of local policymakers , ##OTHER
 local governments should demand more accountability . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
The solution to the problem of Oregon and Washington 's marijuana legalization efforts , ##OTHER
 devised by our movement movement movement , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)*
 is to focus a bit more on the province of individual states ##BASIC STATE
 and to think about the proper response to legalization and the issue of marijuana in general . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
Three hundred sixty-seven of our movement members from five states ##OTHER
 proposed a resolution to federal courts last year ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 declaring ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that local governments can still coerce local governments to monitor their residents ' drug use : ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 "To ensure ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 federal law enforcement conducts its full , mandatory surveillance of the legalization of marijuana , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //2
 that local governments not knowingly engage in government-sanctioned drug monitoring , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 states must establish a clear and pervasive obligation ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 to prohibit citizens from selling any material marijuana with intent ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 to endanger , purchase , possession , ##NONSENSE //3
 or deliver it on any controlled substance , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //2
 and address such criminal activity if necessary. " ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
These are lofty undertakings . ##BASIC STATE
Though marijuana was present in Colorado , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 it was far less popular for the plebiscite . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
As a result , ##OTHER
combined federal and state efforts were stalled , ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 while local political squabbles ##OTHER
 deepened in California over whether , ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
in November 2006 , ##OTHER
 to overturn Measure T-- ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 the city-federal initiative ##OTHER
 that decriminalized marijuana possession for small but intimate use -- ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 got its second reading by a larger margin , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 leaving just 31 % to 38 % . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //3
As politicians wrestled over just how many voters in the two California cities would support the proposition , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 a protest by a grass-roots group started out collecting signatures ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 and later broadened to reaching out to local officials . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
That group then received 75,000 signatures , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 demanding a written law ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that recognized marijuana by the statutory definition . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //4
In a similar vein , ##OTHER
Measure T also ##OTHER
 established what was described as a state-sanctioned " drug abuse assessment " review program ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that worked " effectively after the initial raid on an expanded operation ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
 that resulted in the prohibition of certain types of marijuana . " ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
The backers of the proposal included former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 ( now out of office ) , health officials , and state Supreme Court Justice Mon ##OTHER
