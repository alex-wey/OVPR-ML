We work hard each day ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //3
 to expose fraud and abuse ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //3
 that threatens to unleash a wave of disorder , crime and disease ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Im 52 ##BASIC STATE
 and I read about poverty , crime and drug abuse here and at one time there . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
And then I was hooked on marijuana . ##BASIC STATE
Now Im 53 Im wondering ##BASIC STATE
 why I didnt just drink that morning and then mix it ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and smoke it . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
I didnt tell anyone ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 I smoked pot ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and also I didnt tell anyone ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 I smoked green tea because its highly toxic ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and my husband says ##BASIC STATE
 I must have misunderstood . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
When I lived in Alaska ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 the lifestyle change was like going from a different era to a new one . ##BASIC STATE //4
The prison bus ##OTHER
 I used to walk through was full of men ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 who drank alcohol and smoked pot . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
I was fed up . ##BASIC STATE
I was having trouble sleeping ##BASIC STATE //4
 and I was getting drunk . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
I went to church , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 was encouraged to get to know others , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and so many others just got sick ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 or need medicine . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
I was on antidepressants ##BASIC STATE
 and so many of them didnt do any harm . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //3
If I smoked , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 Id probably wake up from my stress ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and get in trouble . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
I was so miserable ##BASIC STATE
 that I decided never ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 to take a job again ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and put up with the type of poor people ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 I had seen in the criminal justice system . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
And I started taking LSD as a relief , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 just as I did when I read about how violent some of the drivel about these types of problems was . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
I found ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that less people thought of each other and more bought marijuana . ##GENERIC SENTENCEÂ (DYNAMIC) //3
I couldnt take better advice ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and I wrote my story out . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
I had a lot of brothers ##BASIC STATE
 who let me burn them with alcohol and a stack of burners . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
But I was sick of the kind of treatment ##BASIC STATE
 I was trying to dispense with . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Those men just wouldnt tell me ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 where my brother was . ##BASIC STATE
I couldnt get paid . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
And all of a sudden , ##OTHER
 I thought : ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 Now where do I stand ? ##QUESTION
I went to the state of Alaska ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 to check out the fact ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)*
 that marijuana is illegal there . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Id been there before and ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 when I said to the staff ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 what I was seeing ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //4
 they would whip me into a panic , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //4
 then send me to prison ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //4
 and have me sent back . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //4
It sucked . ##BASIC STATE
It hit me the hardest ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 and when I said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)*
 that its OK , ##BASIC STATE //4
 they started to feel comfortable ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //3
 because of the promise ##OTHER
 I made . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Theyd told me ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC) //3
 they didnt know ##BASIC STATE //3
 where Id go . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
In Indiana I got in trouble ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 because I told them ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 Id eaten marijuana earlier . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
The threat of prison and having my earnings then made me think not only about the health risks but also about my freedom . ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
When I went to jail ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 I didnt know ##BASIC STATE
 what I was really doing . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
It hit me to how much it was because of what I was doing . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)*
There are also jail-breaks like the one in California ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 where drug addicts ##OTHER
 who didnt have medicine ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 had to go to jail . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
There there they had to use pot ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 where it was illegal . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
But I didnt have anything like that . ##BASIC STATE
I was $8 a day ##BASIC STATE*
 because I couldnt afford a lawyer or doctor . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)

 I smoked pot ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 when I had to be locked up every day for years ? ##BASIC STATE //3
My oldest had to live in prison ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)

 if we are going to treat our children well ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and not let them down . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
But thats not the situation today . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //4
There are so many anti-drugs and anti-poverty programs out there ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 that ##OTHER

 and offending our conscience ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
