Scientists in Israel are exploring another medical use for marijuana : ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //4
 Their research indicates ##BASIC STATE
 that a compound in the plant helps heal bone fractures . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
The new study , ##OTHER
 published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research , ##BASIC STATE
 found ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that broken bones healed faster and stronger ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 when the patient received the non-psychoactive compound cannabidiol , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
or CBD . ##OTHER
"We found ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that CBD alone makes bones stronger during healing , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 enhancing the maturation of the collagenous matrix , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) 
 which provides the basis ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 for new mineralization of bone tissue ," ##OTHER
said Dr. Yankel Gabet , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
one of the lead researchers , ##OTHER
in a statement . ##OTHER
"After being treated with CBD , ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 the healed bone will be harder to break in the future . " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL) //4
Researchers administered CBD to a group of rats with mid-femoral fractures . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
After just eight weeks , ##OTHER
 they saw marked improvement in the broken bones . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
They injected another group of rats with a mixture of CBD and THC , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
marijuana 's psychoactive ingredient . ##OTHER
Comparing the results , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 they concluded ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that CBD alone was an effective treatment . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Researchers explained ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that humans have a naturally occurring endocannabinoid system , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 which regulates a number of physiological processes as well as the skeleton . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
The human brain and body are thus prepped to be responsive to cannabinoids , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
even those from an outside source like marijuana . ##OTHER
Gabet of the Bone Research Laboratory at Tel Aviv University and the late professor Itai Bab of the Bone Laboratory at Hebrew University led the research . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
A number of studies in recent years have demonstrated the medical potential of marijuana . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC) //4
Purified forms of cannabis ##OTHER
 have been tied to better blood sugar control ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and may help slow the spread of HIV . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
A growing body of research suggests ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 CBD may also be effective in reducing inflammation ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 brought on by multiple sclerosis , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 stopping metastasis in many kinds of aggressive cancer , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 killing cancerous cells in people with leukemia ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and serving as an alternative antipsychotic treatment . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL) //4
"The clinical potential of cannabinoid-related compounds is simply undeniable at this point , " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Gabet said . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Seventeen U.S. states have legalized CBD for limited medical use or research , ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 and 23 other states have more broadly legalized marijuana for medical purposes . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Still , ##OTHER
