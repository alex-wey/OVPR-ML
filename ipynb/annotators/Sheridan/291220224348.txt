I hope ##BASIC STATE
 you found ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 it is clear ##BASIC STATE
 the movement has been dominated by anti-psycho Christian ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 ( like the Tea Party or NORML or the Marijuana Policy Project ) ##OTHER
 evangelicals and hardcore anti-cannabis Christians ##OTHER
 who refuse to endorse churchgoers ' viewpoint ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 ( think Isaiah 45 ) . ##OTHER
In my personal opinion , ##OTHER
their " focus " on cannabis and the lack of evidence ##OTHER
 that it has to do with their Church has nothing to do with the movement as a whole . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
They do n't want anybody to look like you , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 because they certainly would n't be out there smoking weed on their own country. ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
These people are n't pro-weed and pro-lifers . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
They are still " threatening to death " Christian believers . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)*
Steve Dale Birch goes on to say ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that some are " brutal " with his belief ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that marijuana is the exclusive preserve of the black market ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 because they have received nothing from that grey market . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
He goes on to assert ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that marijuana is " no fad , in fact ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 fad because the FDA cannot regulate marijuana " . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
When I saw ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that you were referring to anything and everything ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 I could find in public health literature , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 even if it were from a nut , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //2
 I ( and at best ( and at worst , because I 've never seen anyone with cancer ) ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)*
 would have reached the conclusion ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 that it is off limits because of how rapidly it can be treated ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and that it is open and easy to do . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //2
Sometimes it just gets easier and more difficult . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
People are preoccupied with stuff about health / paranoia and conspiracies ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 and the odds are often ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 what you call abnormal . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Seeing this in your life ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 ( like ##OTHER
 whether we can convince ourselves ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 that there is a Big Will " right " or " wrong " here , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //3
 " friendly " us , ##OTHER*
 how to echos up the possibilities to the fullest ) ##NONSENSE
 I can only draw your sympathy group ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)*
 and say ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 you need to put your shit together ##BASIC STATE //4
 and support the movement ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 to make it stick. ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //3
Sigh . ##OTHER
Now while I believe ##BASIC STATE
 they are at a historical , repressive "good time ##BASIC STATE //2
 to get out there", ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //1
 I can see ##BASIC STATE
 where you and your supporters are looking . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
Most of you are so stupid , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
so paranoid about how the real movement works , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //2
 it 's sad how other people are so completely addicted to marijuana ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 because people are so desperate to get their hair or teeth whitened . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
I can see ##BASIC STATE
 that some of you are very anti-marijuana people . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
You are so obsessed with the state ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and how cannabis can be readily available on the street ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that you think ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 nothing can be more important than making a conscious political and economic decision on how cannabis should be available to everyone . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
You have already successfully lobbied to have no sugary drinks ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 sold in schools , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 fights in local bars are no longer fun ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and you show up on time every election . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
You are desperate to have every house and business-house ready . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
And you are especially desperate for " John & Jo " , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 who you have selected as a primary sponsor , ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 but who live below the poverty line . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
You are desperate to tell people ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that " it is okay to experiment " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 when they have the will to do that . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
You are so convinced ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that destroying the workplace and parenting system is the best way to achieve your desired societal change , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that while being human does n't make you inferior , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 you hate your children . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
You have not only distorted the minds of millions of people , ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 but you have also created a culture ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 that is toxic to human psychology , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 which makes this specific lifestyle of pure undiluted cannabis extremely irresponsible . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //3
And let 's not forget ##IMPERATIVE //4
 that your policies are being completely pro-life and pro-choice too , ##BASIC STATE* //2
 but are deeply misguided and damaging to human rights ##BASIC STATE //2
 whether that be gay rights or lesbian rights. ##BASIC STATE
So ##OTHER
 I have set off the cries ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 that you are n't pro-Marijuana . ##BASIC STATE //3
You wo n't be able to be as critical of the work ##BASIC STATE //2
 you want to do to make society more just ##BASIC STATE
 and mature ##OTHER
 and just as committed to marijuana use , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 as you insist on making sure ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that cannabis is only available to choose between you and your wife , daughter and son. ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)*
Instead ##OTHER
 you may eventually join a genuine movement for an open , stable , and prosperous world ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 where when you are poor ##BASIC STATE //4
 you can smoke on your own too ( just as is common for married married couples ) . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Give those ##IMPERATIVE
 who support marijuana a year ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 to grow theirs ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
 and let me send a video of them telling you ##IMPERATIVE
 how they support the movement to make cannabis less available to humanity . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
