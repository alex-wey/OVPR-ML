A common link between chili peppers and marijuana could have implications for how we treat diabetes and colitis , ##BASIC STATE
as well as other conditions in the digestive tract , ##OTHER
 according to a new study from the University of Connecticut . ##BASIC STATE
The study was published in the April 24 issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Researchers say ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 chemicals ##OTHER
 found in the peppers and marijuana interact with the same receptor in our stomachs . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Scientists first focused on the chemical capsaicin , ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
 which is responsible for the hot sensation of eating a chili pepper . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
They fed capsaicin to mice , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 and found ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 the mice ##OTHER
 fed with the spice had less inflammation in their guts . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Heres a rundown of what happened next : ##BASIC STATE
 When they looked carefully at what was happening at a molecular level , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 the researchers saw ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that the capsaicin was binding to a receptor ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 called TRPV1 , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) //3
 which is found on specialized cells throughout the gastrointestinal tract . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
When capsaicin binds to it , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 TRPV1 causes cells to make anandamide . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Anandamide is a compound chemically akin to the cannabinoids in marijuana . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
It was the anandamide ##BASIC STATE //4
 that caused the immune system to calm down . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //4
Knowing ##BASIC STATE
 that the brain ##OTHER
 also has anandamide receptors , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 researchers began to imagine ways ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 the immune system and the brain ##OTHER
 might talk to each other through the common language of the anandamide , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 explained Pramod Srivastava , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
professor of immunology and medicine ##OTHER
 at UConn School of Medicine . ##OTHER
Researchers found ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //4
 that a greater presence of anandamide led to a greater presence of macrophages , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
immune cells ##OTHER
 that curb inflammation . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
The researchers actually managed to cure mice with Type 1 diabetes ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 by feeding them chili peppers . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
When they skipped to feeding the mice anandamide directly , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 they observed a similar gut-calming result . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Researchers want to head to Colorado , ##BASIC STATE
 where pot is legal , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 so they can further study the effects of ingesting marijuana on anandamide in the body . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Im hoping to work with the public health authority in Colorado ##BASIC STATE
 to see ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 if there has been an effect on the severity of colitis among regular users of edible weed , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 Srivastava said in a press release . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The findings could have implications for various conditions ##BASIC STATE
 found in the stomach , pancreas , intestines and colon . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
