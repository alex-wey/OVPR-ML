I say this as someone ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 who is on the far left ##BASIC STATE
 when it comes to economic and social issues , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and it still feels kind of weird on its way out . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)

 to keep things balanced though . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
