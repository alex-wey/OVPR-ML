Two just-published studies ##OTHER
 assessing adults ' risk of cancer ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 have reported wildly divergent , ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
and fairly extraordinary , ##OTHER
outcomes . ##OTHER
One study you may have read about . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
The other has been ignored entirely by the mainstream media . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
But no doubt the results of both will surprise you . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
First , ##OTHER
the study you may have heard of . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Writing August 3 in the journal Cancer Epidemiology , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 investigators at McGill University in Montreal reported ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that moderate alcohol consumption ##OTHER
 -- defined as six drinks or fewer per week -- ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 by adults is positively associated with an elevated risk of various cancers , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 including stomach cancer , rectal cancer , and bladder cancer . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
And now for the study you have n't heard of . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Writing in the August issue of the journal Cancer Prevention Research , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 investigators from Rhode Island 's Brown University , ##OTHER
along with researchers at Boston University , Louisiana State University , and the University of Minnesota ##OTHER
 reported ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that lifetime marijuana use is associated with a " significantly reduced risk " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma . ##OTHER
Authors reported , " after adjusting for potential confounders ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 ( including smoking and alcohol drinking ) , 10 to 20 years ##BASIC STATE //4
 of marijuana use ##OTHER
 was associated with a significantly reduced risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 ( HNDCC ) . " ##OTHER
Perhaps even more notably , ##OTHER
subjects ##OTHER
 who smoked marijuana and consumed alcohol and tobacco ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 ( two known high risk factors for head and neck cancers ) ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 also experienced a reduced risk of cancer , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 the study found . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"Our study suggests ##BASIC STATE
 that moderate marijuana use is associated with reduced risk of HNSCC , " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
investigators concluded . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
"This association was consistent across different measures of marijuana use ##BASIC STATE
 ( marijuana use status , duration , and frequency of use ) ##OTHER
 .... Further , ##OTHER
 we observed that marijuana use modified the interaction between alcohol and cigarette smoking , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 resulting in a decreased HNSCC risk among moderate smokers and light drinkers , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and attenuated risk among the heaviest smokers and drinkers . " ##OTHER
This is n't the first time ##BASIC STATE
 that U.S. investigators have documented an inverse association between pot use and cancer . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
A separate 2006 population case-control study , ##OTHER
 funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) //3
 and conducted by the University of California at Los Angeles , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 also reported ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that lifetime use of cannabis was not positively associated with cancers of the lung or aerodigestive tract , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and further noted ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that certain moderate users of the drug experienced a reduced cancer risk ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 compared to non-using controls . ##BASIC STATE //4
Predictably , ##OTHER
the federal government 's goal ##OTHER
 when green-lighting the UCLA study ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 was to conclusively establish just the opposite result , ##BASIC STATE
 as explained recently by its lead researcher Dr. Donald Tashkin . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
In an interview with the McClatchy newspaper chain in June , ##OTHER
Dr. Tashkin admitted ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that he expected ##BASIC STATE
 his study would find ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 that pot was associated with " increased health effects . " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Instead , ##OTHER
he summarized , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 "What we found instead was no association ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 ( between marijuana smoking and cancer ) ##OTHER
 and even a suggestion of some protective effect . " ##OTHER
Tashkin added , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 " [ A ] t this point , ##OTHER
 I 'd be in favor of ( marijuana ) legalization . ##BASIC STATE
I would n't encourage anybody ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 to smoke any substances . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
But I do n't think ##BASIC STATE
 it should be stigmatized as an illegal substance . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Tobacco smoking causes far more harm . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
And in terms of an intoxicant , ##OTHER
 alcohol causes far more harm ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 ( than marijuana ) . " ##OTHER
Despite these findings , ##OTHER
 which to date inexplicably remain under-reported by the mainstream press , ##BASIC STATE
 many so-called experts persist with claims ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 that marijuana smoking is causally linked to cancer . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
In fact , ##OTHER
in June the California Environmental Protection Agency with great fanfare added marijuana smoke to its list of chemicals ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that possess potential carcinogenic properties and / ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 or are associated with reproductive toxicity . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
You know ##QUESTION
 what other ##OTHER
 commonly indulged in substance also appears on this list ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
That would be alcohol . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Of course that conclusion , ##OTHER
much like the reports of marijuana 's anti-cancer prowess , ##OTHER
apparently went up in smoke . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
