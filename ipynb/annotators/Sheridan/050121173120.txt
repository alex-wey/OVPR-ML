Last year , ##OTHER
the FDA recognized a new drug ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 for epilepsy ##OTHER
 made from marijuanas own CBD , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //4
 otherwise known as cannabidiol . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
That means ##BASIC STATE
 the marijuana plant may have a confirmed medical use after all . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
So what about medical marijuana and diabetes ? ##QUESTION
Can diabetics use the drug ##QUESTION
 to help their condition ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 or safely use it for pleasure ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
As more states legalize medical marijuana , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 people with all kinds of diseases are wondering this same question . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
However , ##OTHER
diabetics are left reading between the lines of existing studies ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 to make a conclusion . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
The short answer : ##OTHER
 experts dont know for sure . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
People with diabetes can discuss ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 how to safely use medical marijuana with their doctors . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //3
However , #OTHER
the research is slim and sometimes opposing on whether the drug actually helps diabetes . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
One large study ##OTHER
 published in The American Journal of Medicine points to positive benefits for diabetes . ##BASIC STATE
The study was conducted on over 4,600 participants ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 ( NHANES ) survey . ##OTHER
Of those participating , ##OTHER
about 580 used marijuana regularly and over 1,900 had used it in the past . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Interestingly , ##OTHER
 researchers found ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that using marijuana was associated with a lower fasting insulin level ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and a smaller waist size . ##OTHER
A review ##OTHER
 published in the Natural Medicine Journal also highlighted positive outcomes . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The review cited the NHANES study as well as several mice models ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that suggest ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 cannabis protected mice from getting diabetes ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 or reduced its severity . ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
The review also pointed out a study ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 in Israel ##OTHER
 that revealed ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 a low dose of THC , ##OTHER
 well below its psychoactive capabilities , ##OTHER
 could protect the body against organ damage . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
But there are studies ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 showing negative effects too . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
One such study ##OTHER
 published by the American Diabetes Association showed ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that marijuana users tended to consume about 20 percent more food , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 eat a lesser quality diet ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 involving simple carbs , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 have higher blood pressure ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 and have a higher percentage of visceral fat . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
All of these markers could exacerbate diabetes risk . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
To balance these findings , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
though , ##OTHER
 the same study did find ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that marijuana users had lower overall fat content and a lower BMI . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
Other possible ( largely unproven ) ##OTHER
 benefits of medical marijuana ##OTHER
 that many cannabis advocates commonly highlight : ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 Reducing anxiety , Reducing pain and inflammation , Slowing cancer growth , Muscle relaxant , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC) //3
 which could be helpful for multiple sclerosis , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 Controlling side effects of chemotherapy , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
such as nausea and vomiting . ##OTHER
Officially , ##OTHER
the National Institute on Drug Abuse states ##BASIC STATE
 that not enough large-scale studies have been conducted to provide definitive answers about medical marijuana . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
One thing is certain , ##BASIC STATE
though : ##OTHER
 In light of the new wave of cannabis interest , ##OTHER
 this is a field of study ##BASIC STATE
 researchers cannot overlook . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
The difficult task is to conduct such research under available laws , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 which prohibit the use and study of marijuana by the federal government . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Researchers will need to take care to go the proper pathways ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 so that more research can become available and recognized . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
