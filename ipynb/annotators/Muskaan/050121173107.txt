Black farmers in Florida say ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 they are being shut out from the state 's emerging medical marijuana trade , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 and are pushing for changes in the law ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 that would let them break into the limited , legal pot market . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Though Sunshine State voters last fall rejected a broad medical marijuana ballot proposal , ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 a more narrow measure ##OTHER
 ( Senate Bill 1030 ) ##OTHER
 was signed by Gov. Rick Scott nearly a year ago . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The " Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act of 2014 " allows some nurseries to grow " low-THC " pot ##BASIC STATE
 and distribute to " qualified patients " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
suffering from cancer , seizures and muscle spasms . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
But for black growers in the state , ##OTHER
" It 's a bad thing , " ##BASIC STATE
said Florida Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association President Howard Gunn Jr . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Gunn is referencing one line in the law ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that is creating controversy . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
It states farmers must have a license ##BASIC STATE
 to cultivate " more than 400,000 plants " and must have operated " as a registered nursery in [ Florida ] for at least 30 continuous years . " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
According to Gunn , ##BASIC STATE
hardly any black farmers meet that criteria . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
" There were n't that many black farmers 30 years ago in the nursery business , " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
he said . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
" We say ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 they were n't there because of the discriminatory practices 
 set by the USDA . " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Gunn is talking about a case ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 called " Pigford v. Glickman , " ##BASIC STATE
 which started in the 1980s ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 -- it led to one of the largest civil rights settlements in history , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
worth $1.3 billion . ##BASIC STATE
The USDA agreed to compensate thousands of black farmers ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 who allegedly suffered racial discrimination from the USDA 's farm loan program . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Gunn points to that history ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 in explaining ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 why few , ##OTHER
if any , ##OTHER
 black farmers would meet the criteria today ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 to legally grow medical marijuana . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
" Because of that , ##OTHER
 we were n't able to produce as much ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 or be as profitable as [ other ] farmers , " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
he said . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
" If we found one [ black ] farmer ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 growing that many plants , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 it would be surprising . " ##BASIC STATE
There 's an effort afoot in the legislature to address these concerns , ##BASIC STATE
 but it got off to a rocky start . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
After an outcry from black farmers ##OTHER
 opposing the " unobtainable " requirement to grow pot , ##BASIC STATE

proposed an amendment to a separate bill ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)

The underlying bill ##OTHER

 he would work on changing the " discriminatory " language in the bill . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
But that plan did not work out . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The session ended prematurely , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 and neither the bill nor the amendment won approval . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
" Unfortunately , ##OTHER
 the bill did not make it across the finish line , " ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Bradley told XXX , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 He said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 they will work to address the issue ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 when lawmakers return . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
" I think ##BASIC STATE
 [ black farmers ] have a legitimate issue ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and it 's something ##BASIC STATE
 that we will certainly continue to try and address ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 when we 're back in session next year , " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
he said . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Meanwhile , ##OTHER
the sponsor of the original 2014 bill , ##OTHER
state Rep. Matt Caldwell , ##OTHER
said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 he was not aware of the potential effects ##BASIC STATE
 the requirements would have on black farmers . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)

 the ones ##OTHER
 who 've been here the longest should be the first in line , " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 he told The News Service of Florida . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Florida is n't the only state ##BASIC STATE
