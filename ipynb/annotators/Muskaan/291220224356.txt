A recent government pardon ##OTHER
 ( yesterday 's paper Talking Notes ) ##OTHER
 suggests ##BASIC STATE
 that an old judge should n't decide ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 who gets to be the chief judge of a country . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
They are not part of the guidelines . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
There are basically no rules ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 governing ##BASIC STATE
 how a person can legitimately opine on the constitution or policies of a country . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //2
And thus the federal guidelines are only applicable to court cases 
 that are politically motivated . ##BASIC STATE
When fighting for judges , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 you 're more likely to be found wanting by the public prosecutor ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 than the deputy chief judge of a state or city . ##OTHER
A federal judge is only supposed to preside over a state or city case , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC) 
 even if he 's a judge , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 meaning ##BASIC STATE
 that he has the power to actually keep the drunk drunk drunk drunk drunk in a court , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 plus go through all the other things ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC) //3
 that the other judge presides over . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Sometimes it 's just really hard to read a decision ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 when the case is so obvious to everyone ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and the law is so clear ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that you can get away with making it happen . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
There are indeed no rules ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC(
 relating to dropping the landmark ban on " office smokers " and only a ban on substance abuse , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
if any . ##OTHER
But that does n't mean ##BASIC STATE
 that all the people ##OTHER
 who are trying to pass the ban ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 are ignoring the fact ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 that it 's an insulting choice . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
And regardless of the law , ##OTHER
 you probably do n't know ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 what you 're getting into ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 if you really want to succeed in the first place . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Good luck trying ! ##OTHER
