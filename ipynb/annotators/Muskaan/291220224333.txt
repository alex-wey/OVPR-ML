Ok , ##OTHER
I 'm sorry , ##BASIC STATE
 but the OP is part of the problem ##BASIC STATE
 that he condemns . ##BASIC STATE
Just a casual browse through his comments shows ##BASIC STATE
 that he buys into several typical reddit hivemind positions : ##BASIC STATE
Anti-religion : ##OTHER
 > Wow , is n't this the same place ##BASIC STATE
 where they indoctrinate you to pledge allegiance " under God " ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Pro-marijuana ##OTHER
> I do n't smoke weed ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and never have . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
But it pisses me off to see otherwise normal people ##BASIC STATE
 prosecuted to the full extent of the law for smoking a god damn plant . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
It pisses me off to see our tax dollars wasted to pay for a failing drug war ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 and lock people up for years . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
It pisses me off to see our homes ##BASIC STATE
 broken into , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
dogs shot , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and families terrorized ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 because some dipshit cop ca n't read an address correctly . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
It pisses me off ##BASIC STATE
 that our rights are being taken away in the name of buzz-killing . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
It 's insane and idiotic . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
So fuck you . ##OTHER
Anti-war on drugs : ##OTHER
> Nah , ##OTHER
 our Government would rather keep the war on drugs ##BASIC STATE
 so it can hand our taxpayer dollars over to the prison-industrial complex , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and then hope the South / Central American cartels get powerful enough ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that we have to get involved militarily . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Then they can give the rest of our taxpayer dollars to the military-industrial complex 
 and really crack down on our freedoms at home . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Militarized cartels ##OTHER
 blowing shit up in southern California is our government 's wet dream . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Meme : ##OTHER
 > I accidentally the whole pun . ##NONSENSE
Anti-cop : ##OTHER
 > I try to tell people , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 but they 're too fucking stupid to accept it : ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 cops are unconstitutional ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and we 'd be better off without them . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Of course , ##OTHER
the original poster decided ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 he would improve the quality of reddit ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 by submitting high quality articles ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 which challenged our worldview . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Oh wait , ##IMPERATIVE
he did n't . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
I 'll let you see ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 what he actually submitted . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
The point ##OTHER
 I 'm trying to make is that everybody is a part of the problem ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 you decry ##BASIC STATE
 even if you do n't think ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 you are . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
When we down-vote stuff ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that we think ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 is stupid or unreasoned we think ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 we are being judicious and reasonable , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 but when everybody else does it ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 they are just following the hivemind . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Maybe you guys should realize ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 that every other poster on reddit is EXACTLY like you ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and is capable of thinking for themselves ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and when they downvote your shit , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 it 's not because they are following the crowd ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 but because they actually came to that conclusion on their own ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 just like you do when you downvote their shit . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
