Sixty % of all people over the age of 50 are now suffering from PTSD , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 it seems . ##BASIC STATE
Along with the ease with which smokers can smoke with the biggest impact in terms of mental health . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
But how much are those suffering PTSD symptoms actually suffering from that ? ##QUESTION
One way or another , ##OTHER
the majority of the million plus users ##OTHER
 who use marijuana either do not experience symptoms , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 or they are self-medicating . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
And marijuana is obviously much more beneficial than some of the more potent drugs ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

Its health benefits outweigh concerns about the ease ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 with which users partake and treat other conditions , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
thanks to both the impact and the practical benefits . ##OTHER
Marijuana , ##OTHER
quite simply , ##OTHER
has a tremendous cognitive and psychological benefits , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

So my point is : ##BASIC STATE
any add-on to standard prescription meds ##OTHER
 that provides a proven , real-world benefits of up to 50 % ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 is a mistake , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and one of the reasons ##OTHER
 why it isnt a great use of the word " well " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 is because both these problems stem from the treatment side of things , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that is . ##BASIC STATE

 a few of these warnings are you not to be " addicted " to this element of the body , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 even if it is different from the other side of the coin of antidepressants . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

with that individual being " healthy ". ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Thats exactly the two different forms ##BASIC STATE
 of mental health and thats ##OTHER

 actually ##OTHER
 how we are going to cope with these types of medical problems . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
By that , ##OTHER
