Agree , ##OTHER
I usually get quite an odd look from people ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
 when I say ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 we need to legalize more than just weed . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
However , ##OTHER
they often overlook the other possibilities as to why we should legalize more than just weed . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Particularly , ##OTHER
the big two in my opinion , ##OTHER
 have nothing to do with raising money for the USFG . ##BASIC STATE
First , ##OTHER
 despite what the legal system actually says , ##BASIC STATE
 the illegality establishes a stigmatization upon users ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 that typically makes them fear seeking help or aid for their problem ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 because they do n't want to face legal consequences . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
This is my biggest concern , ##BASIC STATE
 because even though I personally believe ##BASIC STATE
 all drugs are safe in moderation , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 as long ##OTHER
 as we keep it illegal ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 we undermine the ability ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 for many people to seek the help ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that they need or desire . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Sure , ##OTHER
it may be because of their ignorance , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 but we are n't going around telling them ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
"it 's okay , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 we will help you ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 if needed " , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 instead we are persecuting them to the fullest extent of the law ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and throwing them in prison ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 rather than provide them with aid . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Second , ##OTHER
the reason ##OTHER
 why there is any drug violence is because of the cartels and the underground market in itself . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Will it sure exist ? ##QUESTION
Sure , ##OTHER
just like the moonshining business still exists . ##BASIC STATE
But it will be immensely weaker ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 than it currently is , ##BASIC STATE
to the point ##OTHER
 where it is hardly noticeable at all by people . ##BASIC STATE
Undermining the providers and producers really begins to stop the violence ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 associated with drug use . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
So , ##OTHER
why do we have drugs illegal ? ##QUESTION
Because of the violence ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 associated ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and to help people avoid the risk of addiction . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
However , ##OTHER
I do n't know anyone ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that is going to randomly decide to become a cocaine addict ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 just because cocaine is legal . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
So the argument ##OTHER
 that legalization opens access to more users is ridiculous to me . ##BASIC STATE
But what are we really doing ? ##QUESTION
We are increasing violence ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and undermining the ability ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 for many to get help . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
The only way ##OTHER
 to truly accomplish our goals behind the drug war ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 is to abolish the drug war altogether . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
