This is the reason why . ##BASIC STATE
Like a boiled egg ##OTHER
 cooked on a granola bar ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 the enemy is a mix of 88 % THC and 80 % CBD , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 so if those conditions are imaginable ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 we would n't have half the problems ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 we have today being a criminal environment . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
There is some substance ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 we do not need , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
mostly for health reasons ; ##OTHER
 we do n't realise ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 how many people grow it . ####GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
It is also quite simply wrong to say ##BASIC STATE
 they are a freedom in a society ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 where making it into law ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 rather than teaching ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 it is actually a virtue . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)

Bolton University ##OTHER
We do n't just have two kinds of cannabis per citizen ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 we do have the knowledge ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that they can grow a number of cannabis plants at home . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
But there are a lot of practical difficulties . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
For one thing , ##OTHER
among many others the military use of marijuana has not been detected by science . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
It is a potentially dangerous substance ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 which , ##OTHER
rather than being decriminalised , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
is likely to have many negative effects . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The Home Rule Act since 1998 has seen almost 100,000 cases dismissed , ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 although when those cases were conducted ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 this has now declined to only about 30,000 . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Storyline for this ##NONSENSE
After John Robinson 's Rebellion a number of years ##OTHER
 ago he suffered heart attacks at a relative 's house ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 so they thought ##BASIC STATE
 he would have to be allowed to eat ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 cannabis may well be a decent way ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 of ending things . ##OTHER
In the press one thing is surely clear , ##BASIC STATE
though : ##OTHER
 we have a very moral society ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and need to recognise that for all the harm and ill and evil that come with what we are doing ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 we must not place our trust in a country ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 led by racists . ##BASIC STATE
Personally , ##OTHER
 I think ##BASIC STATE
 that many are ignoring ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that the struggle to legalize marijuana in this country is a lot more complicated ##BASIC STATE
 than we are imagining . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
While the new law might have some problems , ##BASIC STATE
 it still allows people to grow their own . ##BASIC STATE
That 's a very good idea . ##BASIC STATE
We have a lot of small businesses in , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 what are , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 92,000 wells in the British Isles alone ##OTHER
 but this legalisation will probably kill all those already registered businesses . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
There will be no revenues as a result of the new law . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Scotland should see the cannabis law as part of an overall prohibition against human error . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
There has been a very strong argument for it , ##BASIC STATE 
 and not only from David Cameron , ##OTHER
the current PM . ##OTHER
On the other hand , ##OTHER
earlier this year the Lords showed us something totally different than the rousing self-interest of the Puritans or our press politicians . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
In the hope ##OTHER
 that the new version will be seen as a battle against our own leaders , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 we have to bring this spirit to our new government ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and see ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 how this piece of legislation could actually be fought . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)

Horsham University ##OTHER
Just talking to people ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 who grow pot , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 I was wondering ##BASIC STATE
 if they would like this argument . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
I mean ##BASIC STATE
 marijuana is illegal in 15 states , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 so I could understand ##BASIC STATE
 why they would want to claim ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 they know ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 what they are doing ##OTHER
 and they should n't ; ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 but like I said , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 are they simply looking at recreational cannabis or are they just being rational ? ##QUESTION
I would like to know ##BASIC STATE
 if these people have actually considered the harms ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 associated with early decomposition as harmful to the planet , the environment and even the health of the human body . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
