In a Senate drug hearing ##OTHER
 in April 2016 , ##OTHER
 Sessions said ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that 'we need grown-ups in charge in Washington to say ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 marijuana is not the kind of thing ##BASIC STATE
 that ought to be legalized , ##BASIC STATE
 it ought not to be minimized , ##BASIC STATE
 that its in fact a very real danger .' ##BASIC STATE
( U.S. Senate Drug Caucus ) ##OTHER
 Attorney General Jeff Sessions will soon receive a report ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 he has been waiting for . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
The document , ##OTHER
from the Presidents Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety , ##OTHER
 is expected ##BASIC STATE
 to clarify the federal governments position on marijuana and the conflicts ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that exist between state and federal laws . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
It clear ##BASIC STATE
 what Sessions wants to do : ##BASIC STATE
 Over the past month , ##OTHER
 he has asked Congress for permission ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 to prosecute medical cannabis suppliers ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 who are acting in accordance with their states laws , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 reauthorized civil asset forfeiture ##OTHER
 ( a highly controversial practice ##OTHER
 used in drug cases ) , ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIVE)
 and announced his desire ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 to start a new war on drugs . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
On at least one front , ##OTHER
however , ##OTHER
Sessionss new war on drugs is likely to fail . ##BASIC STATE
In taking on cannabis particularly the medical uses of cannabis he is staking out a position ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that is at odds with powerful interests ##BASIC STATE
 and an overwhelming majority of Americans ##OTHER
 from nearly all walks of life . ##OTHER
This tide is too strong to swim against . ##BASIC STATE
The first obstacle is that the medical community has largely resolved the question ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC) 
 of whether cannabis is clinically useful . ##BASIC STATE
In January , ##OTHER
the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering and Medicine ##OTHER
 ( NAS ) ##OTHER
 reported ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that there is conclusive evidence ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that cannabis ##OTHER
 ( both whole plant and extracts ) ##OTHER
 is clinically effective at treating some diseases , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 including chronic pain . ##OTHER
Cannabis may prove to be a pain management strategy ##BASIC STATE
 that could substitute for opioids for many desperate patients , ##BASIC STATE
 and the National Institute on Drug Abuse ##OTHER
 ( NIDA ) ##OTHER
 acknowledges ##BASIC STATE
 that cannabis may be an effective tool ##BASIC STATE
 to combat the opioid crisis . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Researchers ##OTHER
 studying the relationship between medical cannabis laws and opioid use ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 have found ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 that states with such laws have nearly a 25 percent reduction in opioid-related deaths . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The contrast between opioids ##OTHER
 which killed more than 33,000 Americans in 2015 and cannabis could not be more striking . ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
As NIDA states on its DrugFacts Marijuana Web page : ##BASIC STATE
 There are no reports ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 of teens or adults ##OTHER
 fatally overdosing ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 ( dying ) on marijuana alone . ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
Related : ##OTHER
[ Pot is increasingly legal . ##BASIC STATE
Employers need to stop screening for it . ] ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Further , ##OTHER
medical cannabis may also save lives in unexpected ways . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Data ##OTHER
 published in the American Journal of Public Health in February suggests ##BASIC STATE
 that laws ##OTHER
 allowing it ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 were associated with fewer traffic fatalities . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
While we always have to be careful about making claims ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 that a policy caused an outcome , ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 evidence from multiple studies , ##OTHER
 with careful statistical analyses , ##OTHER
 is building ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 a case that medical cannabis has real , beneficial , spillover effects . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
State governments are a second major hurdle for Sessions . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
States are sharply opposed to his moves to crack down on their cannabis policies .  ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Eight states ##OTHER
 ( with nearly one-fifth of the U.S. population ) ##OTHER
 have legalized recreational cannabis use by adults . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
Even more striking , ##OTHER
29 states and the District of Columbia have approved the medical use of botanical cannabis , ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 with 17 more having cannabis extract laws in place . ##BASIC STATE
This doesnt just save lives ; ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 it also saves money . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
In two studies , ##OTHER
 we find substantial reductions in a broad array of prescription spending for both Medicare and Medicaid in states ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that have medical cannabis laws in effect . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Medicare and Medicaid dont cover cannabis , ##BASIC STATE
 but it nevertheless appears to substitute for many prescription drugs ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 that the programs do cover . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Nationally , ##OTHER
the savings could be in the billions of dollars across the two programs ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 if all states would adopt medical cannabis laws . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
States benefit directly . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
Our work on Medicaid spending ##OTHER
 shows ##BASIC STATE
 that they saved money as much as $98 million in the case of California in 2014 ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 when they implemented medical cannabis laws in an environment ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 in which the federal government took a hands-off attitude . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Related : ##OTHER
 [ Yes , pot should be legal . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
But it shouldnt be sold for a profit . ] ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
And its not just about savings : ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 Cannabis generates substantial economic benefits as well . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
In 2016 , ##OTHER
Colorado saw the cannabis industry grow to about $1.3 billion in sales . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Colorado levies substantial taxes on cannabis ; ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 as a consequence , ##OTHER
 it generated almost $200 million in tax revenue . ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
Recent estimates suggest ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that states will collect nearly $655 million in tax revenue from cannabis sales nationwide . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Not only are those direct contributions to stressed state budgets , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 but those taxes represent tens of thousands of jobs and the associated economic activity . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
At least four state governors recently wrote Sessions ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 to ask him ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 to let states pursue their own policies without federal interference . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Because state budgets would suffer ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 if Sessions reversed the current federal position , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 state attorneys general would have standing to sue the Justice Department to force Sessions to actually implement the 1970 Controlled Substances Act , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 which insists ##BASIC STATE
 that a drug can be listed as Schedule I ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 only if there is no currently accepted medical use . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
The January NAS report , recent revisions to the NIDA position , and literally hundreds of peer-reviewed clinical research articles make clear ##BASIC STATE
 that cannabis has many medical uses . ##BASIC STATE
This , ##OTHER
finally , ##OTHER
 could end conflicts between state medical cannabis laws and federal law : ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 Physicians could legally prescribe cannabis ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and patients could get medical supervision for their care . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
( Of course , ##OTHER
states would still be free to restrict access to medical cannabis ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 if they chose to do so . ) ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
If Sessions does target cannabis as part of his new war on drugs , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 there is one final reason to believe ##BASIC STATE
 the states would win ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and he would lose . ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
The American people want access to medical cannabis . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The most recent Quinnipiac Poll found ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 that 94 percent of Americans support medical access ##BASIC STATE
 when directed by a physician ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 ( including 96 percent of Democrats and 90 percent of Republicans ) . ##OTHER
That poll found 73percent of respondents oppose enforcing federal cannabis laws against state laws . ##BASIC STATE
Nearly three-quarters of the U.S. population lives in states ##BASIC STATE
 that have legalized medical cannabis , ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 and states have powerful incentives to preserve their laws . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
There is almost universal popular opinion in favor of the availability of medical cannabis . ##BASIC STATE
The tide has already turned . ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
