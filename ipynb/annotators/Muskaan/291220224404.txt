In a research study ##OTHER
 funded by the US Government Accountability Office , ##BASIC STATE
 we found ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 that 16 percent of people currently agree with that statement . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
They would wish ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 they were in completely different roles from us ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 if we understood ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 how to spread the word about their rights . ##QUESTION
Voters know their rights ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and support them much better ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 than they do today . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
Of those ##OTHER
 who pay attention , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
85 percent know about them . ##BASIC STATE
Why ? ##QUESTION
Because we all want this stuff , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 especially for our kids , ##OTHER
 where others understand the impact ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 we can have . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The payoffs to these users are primarily due to demand for weed-based weed . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
As demographics change , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 nearly half of likely voters say ##BASIC STATE
 they get a free high-quality weed . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)*
Of these 75,000 young adults in the US alone , ##OTHER
 they 'll likely be shopping for weed ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 when they go through school . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
So if they 're willing to pay a visit to school ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 for a learning process and opportunities for weed from a weed treatment , ##OTHER
 more likely to get involved in a recreational weed habit ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 should they be required to purchase it . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
It 's hard to argue with that . ##BASIC STATE
However , ##OTHER
one can argue ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that the level of demand in the US for weed is astronomical . ##BASIC STATE
As parents are forced to pay for such things at home , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 many adults really do n't understand ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 what 's involved in a weed experience . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
The best we can hope ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 for is that for the majority of teenagers and young adults , ##OTHER
 they take their kids to the doctor ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 and have a medical visit ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 to get a medical marijuana supply . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
The presence of this aphysician , ##OTHER
but not for recreational , ##OTHER
could cause more delays in obtaining a drug . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
They also want to get drugs out of their bodies quicker than possible . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
This is how they price things . ##BASIC STATE
In 2008 , ##OTHER
 the NHS bill became the " Public Health Act " , ##BOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
a document ##OTHER
 that pre-empted public health procedures until today . ##BASIC STATE
That causes many young people to overdo their doctor 's visits . ##BASIC STATE
Indeed , ##OTHER
public health professionals believe ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 this is one of the greatest problems of their profession , ##BASIC STATE
 having reached the peak of their powers at the beginning of the 20th century , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 when a single physician could not collect enough needles ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and a nurse could not help people . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
That 's why big-market outlets like the US Food and Drug Administration and Central America Drug Advocacy Agency have come together ##PERFECT COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 to develop recommendations on legalizing all recreational weed or anyone else . ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
These drugs are supposed to help people ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 by helping them live a low-impact lifestyle ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 that helps them " affirm , elevate and commit to themselves . " ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
They can make " meaningful " difference in people 's lives ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 and can bring shame to a drug addict ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 who might otherwise get help . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
This approach will hopefully lead to a healthy mainstream acceptance of recreational use . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
