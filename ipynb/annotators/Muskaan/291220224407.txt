I think ##BASIC STATE
 one of the issues ##OTHER
 we face ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 when saying ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
'x reprehensible crime ##OTHER
 should result in people ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 being locked away ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 forever' ##OTHER
is a problem of equivalency . ##BASIC STATE
Do you also believe ##BASIC STATE
 that murder should result in life without parole ? ##QUESTION
If not , ##COERCED STATE (SPECIFIC)
 are we as a society ##QUESTION
 then saying that murder ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
 is less bad than molesting children ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Insert other heinous crime ##IMPERATIVE
 and work your way through . ##IMPERATIVE
Although it 's unlikely ##BASIC STATE
 that people ##OTHER
 who carry out such acts ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 think them through logically , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 there 's also an issue of deterrence of even worse crimes . ##BASIC STATE
If you 're already potentially getting life without parole ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 for molesting the child , ##BOUNDED EVENT (GENERIC)
 why not just kill them as well ? ##QUESTION
While there might be theoretical pros and cons for doing so for a criminal in that situation , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 you remove a potential deterrent for committing the additional crime . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Another point is that the justice system is , ##BASIC STATE
in addition to its punitive nature , ##OTHER
 intended to function as a rehabilitation and treatment centre . ##GENERALIZING SENTENCE (STATIC)
If we discover ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 that pedophilia is in some circumstances a treatable illness , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 what then do we say to these people ? ##QUESTION
Sorry , ##OTHER
we can fix you , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 but you can never come out ? ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Or do we make allowance for the notion ##QUESTION
 that they could be rehabilitated ? ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Such a thing would not necessitate instant release - ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 that would defeat the purpose of the punitive sentence , ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
 but could theoretically be incorporated into future parole bids . ##COERCED STATE (GENERIC)
Obviously we 're not there yet , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
 but ##OTHER
 it is certainly a possible occurrence in the future . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Finally I think ##BASIC STATE
 you also have a problem with mandating sentences , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
or a specific sentence , ##OTHER
for a crime . ##OTHER
Each crime is different , ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
in the circumstances of the accused , ##OTHER
the impact on the victim and their family and the impact on society . ##OTHER
Legislated mandatory sentences remove any leniency for any circumstances . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (HABITUAL)
To take a particularly unjust analogy ; ##UNBOUNDED EVENT (SPECIFIC)
 a three strikes drug law could see a person using marijuana for chronic pain ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 jailed to the same degree as your local mid level dealer . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
Obviously it 's not really analogous to your position , ##BASIC STATE
 but these kind of things do happen ##GENERIC SENTENCE (DYNAMIC)
 where strict mandatory sentencing guidelines exist irrespective of circumstances . ##GENERIC SENTENCE (STATIC)
