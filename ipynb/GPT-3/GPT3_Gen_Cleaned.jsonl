There are plenty of elderly white farmers in the state without 30 years operating experience who can sell their licenses, brush shoulders with the state and corner a deal. Meanwhile, minority farmers dealing in other types of retail goods and services cannot sell or transfer their current business permits to cannabis farms as a money-making venture, albeit legal. That means \"through no fault of their own,\" said Gunn, \"my brethren [African Americans] are prevented from making a decent living in comparison to their white counterparts.\""}

The same researchers had previously found that marijuana users were at higher risk of cognitive decline and descent into lower social and economic strata, but the new study suggests the same isn't true for physical health. \"The only measures that seemed to indicate any really serious health problem was periodontal disease,\" said senior author Terrie Moffitt, of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. In periodontal disease, the gums around the teeth become inflamed, according to the National Institutes of Health. The gums pull away from the teeth, creating pockets that can become infected. Left untreated, periodontitis can lead to loss of teeth. For the new study, the researchers studied 1,037 people born in New Zealand in 1972 and 1973. Participants were tracked from age 3 to age 38. Overall, about 65 percent reported using marijuana at some point after age 18, according to the results in JAMA Psychiatry.", "summary": null, "finish_reason": "length", "generation": " Around 15 percent reported using marijuana in the past year, and 14 percent reported using it in the past month. Current users were at an increased risk for gum disease compared to former users, but not current tobacco smokers. There was also an increased risk of gum disease among current adults who both smoked tobacco and used marijuana, the researchers found. It's not clear how marijuana use increases the risk of gum disease, Moffitt said. But in some of the study participants, marijuana use was also linked to more frequent flossing and use of a mouthwash. The researchers adjusted for factors such as smoking, alcohol and caffeine intake, periodontal disease diagnosis, and participants' education and income level. None of those factors could explain the link between marijuana use and more frequent flossing or frequent and heavy use of mouthwash -- two behaviors reportedly performed more in people who reported marijuana use. While these findings are interesting, more research needs to be conducted."}

The Highway Loss Data Institute, a leading insurance research group, said in study results released Thursday that collision claims in Colorado, Washington, and Oregon went up 2.7 percent in the years since legal recreational marijuana sales began when compared with surrounding states. Legal recreational pot sales in Colorado began in January 2014, followed six months later in Washington, and in October 2015 in Oregon. \"We believe that the data is saying that crash risk has increased in these states and those crash risks are associated with the legalization of marijuana,\" said Matt Moore, senior vice president with the institute, which analyzes insurance data to observe emerging auto-safety trends. Mason Tvert, a marijuana legalization advocate and communications director with the Marijuana Policy Project, questioned the study's comparison of claims in rural states such as Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana with Colorado, Oregon and Washington that have dense population centers and how that affected the study's findings. \"The study raises more questions than it provides answers, and it's an area that would surely receive more study, and deservedly so,\" Tvert said.", "summary": null, "finish_reason": "length", "generation": " \"It's impossible to know now how affected individuals are by marijuana since the testing of drivers for marijuana isn't standardized.\" Tvert also objected to the study's use of non-marijuana testing data to control for \"what's happening with individuals who are not using marijuana.\" He said that for far too long, marijuana has been believed to be a \"zero-risk product\" and the public deserves to have the same information about marijuana use as they do about alcohol."}

Those questions are especially important for one group: pregnant women. Marijuana use during pregnancy is becoming more common , despite the lack of clarity about its possible effects. But today (Aug. 27), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released its first-ever guidelines on marijuana use for pregnant and breast-feeding women. The new recommendations are based on an analysis of the existing research on how marijuana affects pregnancy, breast-feeding and childhood development, and they touch on a range of questions that expectant parents might have. [ 7 Ways Pregnant Women Affect Babies ] Here are the most important takeaways from the report. Don't use marijuana, in any form, during pregnancy. The AAP report concludes that completely avoiding marijuana use during pregnancy is best. That's in part because THC , or tetrahydrocannabinol the compound responsible for marijuana's psychoactive effects can cross the placenta. Several long-term studies have found relationships between marijuana use by pregnant women and slightly shorter gestational periods and lower birth weights, according to the report.", "summary": null, "finish_reason": "length", "generation": " But whether those changes are clinically meaningful is unclear. Also, the effects of THC on the endocrine and reproductive systems in moms and babies aren't well understood. Because of all the unknowns, the AAP says women who are pregnant or breast-feeding should avoid using marijuana altogether. It's also a good idea to avoid using or handling marijuana while pregnant or breast-feeding in case of accidental ingestion. No one should use marijuana recreationally during breast-feeding. The report also discourages women from using marijuana recreationally for as long as they are breast-feeding. (Some women love feeding their babies marijuana-infused breast milk made with oil , a practice that may more and more mothers on social media.) Those babies could suffer a range of symptoms, including increased \"jitteriness, \"elevated body temperature, decreased sleep duration and overall hyporesponsiveness.\" The authors note these are symptoms of ingesting the drug, but they don't know if the substances in marijuana that cause the symptomps in babies."}

The drugs were found in the same plant that was recently visited by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO). The discovery took place this week in Cadereyta when Federal Police officers found 45 marijuana plants hidden within the brushy back area of the facility. Cadereyta is approximately 110 miles south from the border city of Reynosa. The refinery is run by controversial state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex). Information provided to Breitbart News by law enforcement sources revealed the plants were initially found by Pemex security guards who contacted federal authorities. The rear part of the facility is federally restricted but rarely supervised, law enforcement sources revealed. In May, AMLO and Nuevo Leon Governor Jaime Rodriguez Calderon visited the refinery to oversee a series of repairs. It remains unclear how federal authorities who oversee AMLOs security missed the grow operation.", "summary": null, "finish_reason": "length", "generation": " Prior to taking power, AMLO promised he would shut down a lot of Pemex operations to save money. Also, in September, the El Paso Times revealed Pemex secretly imported and laundered millions of dollars in ill-gotten gains for Mexican drug cartels. All of this shows how easy it is for Mexican drug cartels to gain control of Mexico\u2019s economic infrastructure. Further frustration was exhibited by the president of the local business chamber at Mexico\u2019s Cadereyta plant, who claimed the illegal activity found inside the state oil refinery had become more intense. RAMFEL officials said they are fed up with the lack of vigilance and security, for what they claim is a serious breach in the law enforcement area of the refinery. It is the same refinery that has produced a major increase in violent crime in the area, even in the cities commercial areas."}
