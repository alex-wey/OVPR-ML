So. ironically, prohibition is what gives rise to your so-called \"new drugs\", because \"new drugs\" are means to circumvent detection through cheap, dangerous, experimental knock-offs. \"Spice\", for example, is billed as a *legal alternative* to marijuana. And bath salts, for example, are billed as a *legal alternative* to cocaine and amphetamines. And how do I know all of this? Because of Portugal. Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2001. And now they proudly report the fewest users of these \"new drugs\" among all countries with data tracking \"new drug\" users.

This is similar to the potential opposite view, being Pro Choice but also Anti Death Penalty. For the first one, you can\\'t hold the principle \"Killing another human being is only morally permissible in self defense\", because the Death Penalty is not an act of self defense. Similarly, you can\\'t hold the principle if you\\'re pro-choice and anti-death penalty as abortion is not an act of self defense. (You could get around this though by defining a fetus as not a human being, but you do run into the issue of defining human being more clearly) For example, if I gave you the political positions of \"I am in favor of legalizing marijuana\" and \"I am in favor of increasing foreign aid\", there isn\\'t generally an issue. Any principle that would support legalizing marijuana will not usually come into conflict with a position regarding foreign aid. But with an issue like Pro-Life vs Pro-Choice and regarding the death penalty, both involve issues of human life directly being killed, so any principles that support one must not come into conflict with the other, or else you risk acting in contradiction to your own beliefs.

       "             'I thought initially you were going to argue for a confederate system but you are basically asking for a unitary system. I think federalism is a good compromise because different states have different values.. take for example marijuana. In a unitary system we would not have States were marijuana is legal. That would require congress to approve and right now there is little support among conservatives so at least some liberal states are passing marijuana laws. Since federalism allows states to experiment it leads to congress being able to observe the results. Eventually marijuana will be legal in all 59 states but if no state took any risk to see what would happen if it was made legal it would take much longer. Same thing with same sex marriage. As late as 2008 a majority of Americans were against same sex marriage but it allowed some states to legalize it and the Supreme Court eventually legalized it everywhere. One recent example is trump wants to get rid of emissions requirements for cars. Basically Obama made a law saying that cars needed to incrementally be more energy efficient. California put up their own emissions requirements so since they are so big car manufacturers are just applying it to all its cars. Trump is currently in a legal battle with California over this issue.

There was the election of Trump, there was the rise of Trumpism, there was the marginalization of conservatives in the senate, and there was a conservative minority in Congress.\\nThe victorious Trump was the elected embodiment of this strange dichotomy, here in America, we have some large, small, liberal states using anti-bureaucratic muscle and their unrealistic, empty dreams of national power and greater government.\\nOn paper we have all the answers, but then not in what is a complex and complicated system of governance, the bureaucracy, the political structures, democracy, and the partisanship that governs politics, legislatures, and oversight.\\nPoliticians, they should have been established many years ago with different virtues, different values, different ideologies, varying set of parameters and assumptions and language and they started out with one goal: to screw, demagogue, ruin, and overthrow the working class.\\nThe one goal of the non-trivialized Communist Party, the baddy who conspired with communists to orchestrate the downfall of the United States and then the Communist League, is the overthrow of the corrupt and corrupt elites, governments, power centers, civil liberties and basic security.\\nSo the first political experiment in modern American society is the systematic overthrow of the system of local government and the marginalization of powerful control over the product and liberties on all levels, including the public goods, including the services.\\nHere is how you make it happen: elected officials are controlled by local communities, legislatures, governors mansions, and senatorial representatives. The federal government is therefore subordinate to local governments and the local control of their official interests.\\nOn the surface we know all the centralized control in our society, but our model still requires redistribution, redistribution of wealth, redistribution of revenues, and redistribution of opportunity.\\nTake love thy neighbor as an example: new universal health care system must be passed, constitutional amendments requiring all individuals to have insurance are written and adopted to discourage the practice of syphoning down benefits. These want to give in to the public demands of people desperate to see if they can get a shot at a new life, because they cant afford the basic basic necessities that it was not for them.\\nOn the surface, yes but if you cut back the government power you will end up diminishing the aggregate power of one unelected small group of people who purport to be democrats.\\nThe reach of this system, this world of government, is deeply fragmented and often ludicrous, a little like a small non-civilized family looking at the dynamic of various political factions, drawing the outline of a less organized family. We need thoughtful monitoring of how the political norms can be more and more diverse, also changing the model of governance, even recognizing that while one unitary system will have no actual power, the definition of separate and unable states may differ based on member number, demographic characteristics, hierarchy and interests.\\nWe need a federation of states which coordinates our society. There are state governments that are both conglomerates and supra-royal and quite the cool polytechnic kind of group. There are state and state-specific elections and a constitution that reflects their individual communities and international alliances. You will find too many such councils to really have a role in making a well-rounded state, but there are two possibilities that may emerge, one being pragmatic states like Utah and Vermont that start out producing the goods that everyone needs, that also have direct influence over the results of local races. Each one, however, should be mindful of the differences among its population groups, and that also allows state-level branches of politics.\\nI could go on and on but my preference is to conserve as much power as possible, limit the right of anyone on any level of government to control every aspect of our society  to subsidize the legislators of our elected representatives, to set the terms of basic liberty in a sound and rational way, to ensure that the state never has too much influence on everything but the economic interests of the state, to not default to the status quo, or to independence.\\n': '051020131206.txt',\n",

I want to bring you closer to the time when those who enjoy liquor as punishment and pardon use it as peace and order to begin some long holiday celebrations. No-one can beat the booze  and some of those celebrating these rituals in their sleep have a strong social bias against alcohol. Instead, they elect to drink more in reaction to changing circumstances and in their mind, which makes them a lot less tolerant, in some cases as you probably know. Few parties survive to the end, and its even harder to make friends with your friends of your own intellectual or visual persuasion. Seasoned young people go to party spots now that make up less than 10% of the population. That is not how I see it.\\nSooner or later that will change  as it has in both maths and a lot of scholarly literature and scholarly culture and times we are already living in. At the very least, there may be a need for a private and public place as soon as possible to share these experiences. Yet still others are forced to pick up just too little oxygen in the night  sometimes so much that it tears at your already established ego or hurts what good you can accomplish.\\nThis might be for the great causes, but with a bit of awareness, one could even take the seed of the ideas of those I abhor the old things in various ways. There are fun texts about the social values of alcohol and pot. There are men and women rethinking the ways of alcohol and drugs  taping our minds about the road of shame. In many of these conversations, there is the light at the end of the tunnel and an aspiration for change. But there are far more exciting ways to involve ourselves as Homo sapiens in our growing and much more exciting lives, than alcohol and drugs in the narrow circle of politics, dialogue and anthropology.\\nBack at the bus stop. People ask me where we are from, but I think we are from a few places. Back in the Day of the Indian and Chinese Diaspora. Back in 1967 when the Indian wars were all but over, Indian Gen. Myron Joseph Benben talked to me about his stint in Pakistan. I think he was like that for all of the students in his generation. He met a woman from Tibet. I know both of those kids for a fact. It was at that time that a wave of Indian immigrants to the US first sailed on the Potomac and took over our town.\\nBack then, I think of you as kind of the agnostic at home, the one with a full faith in the cause of all life in its most nourishing and ignorable conditions, the person who keeps a mental resume with an acre of rice and a trusted family with a waiting list of vital supplies that allow them to ride on the boat and through the mud. All this while you kept putting you into interviews, or even running short stories on the end  these deep and intimate conversations reveal in the writing what you think of the world as a marriage of love and the hopes of its parents, that have eaten the less fortunate into oblivion, that you and your family are destined for the very real threat of more wasted lives, less well fed and more demoralised and unemployed.\\nMaybe at this point its not going to be adequate encouragement for our fledgling novelist/artists in a time of need.

I did educate people on medicinal use of marijuana, methamphetamine, and peri-psilocybin.\\nMY first prescription of cannabis was for symptoms of inflammation and reactions but on the other hand I missed the beneficial effects of the drug for such a long time. My friend Marie from London told me the migraines were just as serious and I asked her why.\\nYet I didn't take any information out of the children who were so ignorant on medicinal uses of cannabis, and wrote down the positive things that she had learned from her research about medicinal use of cannabis, even if this information came directly from others.\\nThe simple truth is that someone who has an addictive drug will generally do well once they get it with the other ingredients. And without a prescription, they wouldn't be overdoing it. For any adults, their parents or friends, who do a lot of drugs, many are probably too ignorant to understand what is wrong with them and the drugs to do nothing about it.\\nHowever, in these days of drug addiction it is best to avoid alcohol, painkillers, pain relievers and psychedelics such as tequila, the latter more toxic than marijuana, and drugs known as terpenes tend to lead to powerful and long lasting reactions in a manner that is at odds with what is available in the marketplace.\\nThings go wrong with these drugs when cannabis is both unregulated and unregulated in a way we rarely hear about because they are illegal. It has the potential to create a brain, which was destroyed by psychotic lovers who drank and smoked it for months on end.\\nBefore many people have their worst experience of cannabis in their parents they should have their best chance of buying it and making more of it to stop the drug from developing in the first place.\\nAs much as there are people who go on drugs they become addictive and make you feel great, they start to have negative feelings.\\nBeing in school or driving around in the morning, or while going to school, does not have an addictive effect that will ruin your child's life or their studies. I felt glad I never took an overdose because of the pain and brought more happiness to myself and my family.\\nAs I have written before, it is important that anyone who has someone who has ever done drugs of choice take steps to reduce his or her risks of opioid dependence by monitoring their cell phone activity and taking random medication. That includes talking to experts to find out what risks are present in your loved one, and getting advice from doctors to prescribe less harmful medications.\\nThe biggest problem with these drugs is that they have no stimulant and can take a long time to free up energy and increase protein production. We treat alcohol consumption as a part of a normal life; heroin users are not drug users, alcohol use is not a problem, and there are no known adverse side effects from legal methods such as smoking cigarettes.\\nA good education is necessary before you get in the habit of engaging in regular drugs of choice such as heroin and other painkillers. For people who do use opiates like Xanax and Molly, or opium, heroin is safer than legal street drugs such as Oxycontin and Vicodin and will help heal chronic pain and anger management.\\nOne of the best educational articles I wrote in 2014 about these activities was Rosalind Denton's Curious Citizenship, which talked about personal experiences for kids who are addicted to substances.\\nMy first prescription of cannabis was for symptoms of inflammation and reactions and was an educational exercise.\\nAs the pain grew, I realized how many other people around me had similar experiences.

       "             'In 2014 - the year the US passed a law that allows states to let doctors prescribe marijuana for certain conditions, including cancer, drowsiness and erectile dysfunction. After four weeks, you had a problem. The result: a $10 million fine.\\nIn 2014, the year of legalization, is one that has almost triggered a gigantic production surge in small, artisanal craftshops, and not one. Agribusiness, the third sector of the economy - which includes everything from wood products to carpenters - was the biggest winner of the legalization period. It sparked a new wave of artisanal craft startups all over the world, as it means that practically no one else had anything to do with it.\\nNow, a new batch of companies is ready to go along with some of the deals: small businesses born out of desperation have the right to try to cash in on the drug, just like anywhere else: as small businesses compete to maintain the integrity of the land, particularly before the six-month testing period expired.\\nThose artisanal businesses will create the shape of a New York with the economy intact, producing goods that could be sold back, but not for long, amid the shifting political landscape of the US and why he has traditionally been a star performer.\\nThere\\'s a small circle of entrepreneurs, which is not easily integrated into most businesses, who often just want to make an extra buck and a friend from work. That\\'s good. It\\'s a noble business objective, perhaps one that should never be overlooked when it comes to valuing workers and their livelihoods.\\nThe mega-regulatory certainty, thanks to the rapid expansion of state medical marijuana regulations, has once again made that route - which had previously served as a roadblock for smaller artisanal crafts - possible. But why was my reputation so high? Wasn\\'t it an opportunity to become one of the giants of the craft business? For one thing, small businesses don\\'t have the same insider networks as the corporate class, which tends to favor big names like Apple, Microsoft, Google and Facebook. While little is being built - or changed - these do belong to the elite. While large, well-known names like Amazon or Starbucks or IBM might face legal scrutiny, small-time artists like myself always start or close to the likes of Amazon and Wells Fargo, which usually have our passports.\\nGlobally, entrepreneurial jobs are actually disappearing. The bottom line here is that the middle class isn\\'t valued as much as they once were. And many more are unable to make a living by manufacturing the things they invented or learned to make with a certain skill. Nobody, including me, speaks up about the economic and social factors in that position. They just say, \"I\\'m not saying we won\\'t develop all the innovative craft that we knew we could create.\"\\nThe best way to find out is to check your payroll records, and don\\'t have to. They just don\\'t have a sales team. And while this might sound preposterous, the only way we can get a piece of this noise is to be overconfident in our predictions of what the new law might do and the mass acceptance that will come from small businesses.\\n': '051020131153.txt',\n",

Or are our deeper concerns about food being too much, or not enough, or not enough, to be worthy of the title of modern-day WHO?\\nSurely it\\'s obvious that the internet is far more active than usual and often features big names on its front page, and a few of them aren\\'t getting any coverage on their website. But the much more so public debate surrounding the matter will not be over here. Many people will see the argument for and against the cannabis industry as unlikely, and only because they just don\\'t have a track record of having created such a fertile ground for the findings.\\nWill we be happy to pick up on any anecdotes like the one around the middle of this week that are just plain plain untrue? It\\'s coming: the headlines like this: Golden Cup & Nicera #100 leaf, only cannabis was legal in San Francisco. Good news for cannabis advocates! Restaurants fear legalisation of #cannabis due to surge in cannabis sales. Legalisation is on the horizon, Deal keeps New Yorkers out of city, and so on.\\nAnd therein lies the rub. This is not just the widespread fear for the industry and the general national picture. Some of the authors seem to have moved on from previous work, and are quickly retreating again. All of them seem to have moved on to work.\\nIs there anything more distressing, and perhaps more damaging, in the way that the folk that contribute to it are supposed to present themselves in the way they present themselves and what they say? Is that how a bunch of light-hearted exponents of a healthy lifestyle feel? Does anyone really believe them anymore? If they\\'re indeed the peddlers who believe that they\\'re the problem here, don\\'t they feel they should stop selling, and just accept?\\nOnce again, the argument takes a back seat to that of cannabis and health. Or, to put it like this, marijuana is rarely widely used, but there is a debate about whether a growing number of independent dispensaries have a right to market their products like wine, beer and mayonnaise. In fact, the impact on health of the synthetic cannabis industry is immeasurable.\\nSo how would the arguments over these challenges in state legislatures work? The answer is very complicated. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 0.4 percent of the population has marijuana. Today it\\'s 2.7 percent. Several states have passed laws that protect these users against legal dangers for marijuana use. There is none for recreational use. And those in favor of medical marijuana generally like the idea of supporting the industry, rather than stigmatising it.\\nBut may the argument be a little hard to win over? Who cares about convictions, discretion, and occasional joy-filled moments? So far, most states have pursued new laws to protect patients from pot and marijuana from cannabis. But there is significant opposition to this law, which involves the presumption that people on medical/non-medical grounds and whoever\\'s in the position to sign up to it must be careful to avoid being too much in the wrong, nor having ulterior motives.\\nBut the evidence on popularity and policy has proved very poorly and is simply not compelling. This newspaper points out that while the documentary film clip about the Marihuana Marketplace in Boston was quite widely circulated, only 36 people of that population tested positive for marijuana.\\nUltimately, it takes the very best arguments on both sides to win and to see the arguments re-emerge. And it\\'s very difficult to get away from such pitting.\\nI understand that some \"obey-up\" rumours can be over the line, but I don\\'t like being woken up at 7am by dizzying science surveys and convinced I can no longer rely on any of them for information. And those were only the movies in which the argument over coffee careered off into the sticky pot. There may be more good news than worse.

We started to absolutely crush people's lives because they didn't want to sell a wedding cake to a gay couple. We expanded the scope of laws a thousand fold, and we got affluenza kid. We got teenagers being charged with manufacturing child pornography cause they sent they bf a topless pic and their teacher took their phone and searched it without their consent.So you know, I am completely done with the idea that special people shouldn't be treated the same way. I think if Hillary clinton got caught smoking weed she should go to jail for as long as a black 25 year old with a criminal record.Either the laws apply to the king as much as they do the lowest person, or we revert to the 1600's.Do you know we have more people in jail by a % of our population than Russia, Iran, or China?\": '11776.txt',\n",
       "             'That doesn\\'t answer anything the poster saidIt offers an evidenced theory as to why cannabis has a medical effect on the human body and isn\\'t simply an excuse to get stoned. See the answer to the third question below.  The endocannabinoid system processes chemicals secreted by the human body. It functions and is useful even in somebody who doesn\\'t use cannabis at all.Exactly. Medicine is used because something is wrong and a symptom needs to be addressed.   Claiming that the existence of chemicals in nature that our body can process does not mean our bodies developed in symbiosis with those chemicals. Which is why theories are explored and supported or discarded. Plant cannabinoids interact with humans in specific ways within the endocannabinoid system. So the symbiosis is simply an established fact. This symbiosis has known medical applications.Humans are just another mammal on a space rock who happened to have evolved an endocannabinoid system to regulate certain mammal body functions. Humans can also process external plant-derived cannabinoids to known therapeutic effects. On this human-inhabited space rock grows a cannabinoid plant which may be one of the first human domesticated plants stretching back into our unknown prehistory.I may be using the term \"evolve\" a little loosely, but the connection between the plant, the mammal and these specific chemicals occurred on a small space rock over a long period of time.  You\\'re making the same mistake as those Intelligent Design folks.No need to be snarky, but you do raise a hilarious point.If one is to assume a cosmic watchmaker, then she designed da weed for a reason. Christians should be the biggest pot heads. God made grass after all. Or is that the infamous tree of the knowledge of good & evil that pisses god off so much?': '20741.txt',\n",
       "             \"Thank you. People downplay the mental effects of weed too much. It's the same thing with alcohol. Not everyone who drinks will end up with problems (though many do) and they either deal with it or quit.It's literally the same thing with weed. And a large portion of people who smoke weed and might have some mental effects just continue smoking, so they never find out what those effects are. People say weed isn't addictive, but I can tell you there definitely is a craving sensation after you smoke for a while. Plus, you feel shitty without weed if you've been toking constantly for a long time. Isn't that the same thing as withdrawal? If not in a physical sense, then in a mental sense (due to lack of cannabinoids in the brain lifting your mood). Then again, since the brain is a physical organ, maybe it is physical.But I digress, some people can deal with it just fine - but there are downsides to consistent weed usage. Mainly mental. It makes you lazy as shit compared to if you were sober. It can lead to depression, anxiety, or just lowered motivation and drive in general. It's funny because all these kind weed downsides were commonly referenced by stoners themselves or stoner movies, songs, etc. I'm not saying that everybody will experience these things, but that they are a real possibility. This kind of reminds me of the backlash people would get when someone pointed out the deleterious effects of cigarettes or alcohol back in the day - I'm talking about decades ago. Most people said they were fine and that it was bullshit. But look where we are today. I think it'll take time until people calm down and actually assess the situation.I'm all for legalization and recreational use. But seriously, all things in moderation.\": '22886.txt',\n",

Yes, it is one of the reasons that people want it legal, but you can't say people who want it legal are short minded. There are other reasons to legalization, such as how it *is* fairly safe. Better than alcohol, and that is legal. Also, we are wasting tax dollars and labour for the imprisonment of people who were using marijuana. Do you think it is right to ruin a person's life because of smoking a plant that makes the happy? We can also generate alot of money for us if it is sold in stores and taxed.Also, one of the reasons why tobacco was assumed safe is because we didn't have all the technology to analyze it that we do today. When we got this tech, we realized that it was bad. Now with pot, he have analyzed it and it is shown that it is not so bad. TL;DR being a cure is not the only reason people want it legalized, saying that people who want it legal are short minded is infactual and just doesn't make sense.\": '17142.txt',\n",

I agree there are genres of porn that you can stumble upon that promote unsafe ideas i.e. abuse, rape, etc. but generally you need to include those sorts of things as search terms in order to actually find them. Children should be taught this sort of thing is wrong and that consent and a condom are the golden two for any encounter they may have in the future. I also believe children are smart enough to realise things like 2 girls 1 cup aren't exactly the norm. There is always going to be ways for pre adults to view pornography, whether there is a law in place or not.Which is why instead of stigmatising it and discouraging conversation, we should promote safe and secure ways people can use pornography. In the UK, marijuana is an illegal drug to distribute despite it being relatively safe compared to many other drugs (including alcohol and tobacco). However, classifying it as similar to cocaine or meth has restricted the conversation on it and causes people to become misinformed about the effects of the drug and stigmatises those who use/sell it. *Despite the law, people will still consume marijauna.

New high in support for legalizing marijuana Fully 50 percent of Americans say the use of marijuana should be legal according to a Gallup poll released Tuesday, the highest in polls since 1969, when just 12 percent favored legalization. Almost as many, 46 percent say marijuana should remain against the law, but that number has softened over the past decade, down from more than seven in 10 in the mid-1990s. Liberals and those under age 30 are the strongest supporters of legalizing marijuana, while support is lowest among conservatives and those over age 65.

Cain stands at 31 percent to Romneys 28 in South Carolina among likely GOP voters (the difference is not statistically significant). In Florida, Cain and Romney stand at 32 and 33 percent, respectively (including those who lean toward a candidate). Texas Gov. Rick Perry places a distant third in both states with about 10 percent support; other candidates are in single digits. Blame government or Wall Street for economy? The Occupy Wall Street movement has heightened scrutiny of the role banks and financial institutions played in the financial crisis, but a new Gallup poll finds that when forced to pick a bogeyman for the nations economic problems, the public blames government over Wall Street by more than 2 to 1 (64 percent to 30 percent). Even among supporters of the new movement, the blame splits 54 percent for Wall Street and 44 percent for government. Tea party supporters are less divided; 82 percent say the federal government deserves the most blame. Wall Street still earns plenty of blame from the public. In separate questions, 78 percent of adults say financial institutions on Wall Street deserve at least a fair amount of blame for the nations economic woes. Somewhat more, 87 percent, say the federal government deserved substantial blame.

Marijuanaa gateway drug aimed at almost anyone with severe addiction and multiple partnershas propelling industry incentives, and the invention of the middleman.\\nThe drug business has pulled into the pharmaceutical field with life. The main key players are the opioid-addiction nurses, and their firms rake in hundreds of millions of dollars every year from advertising. Companies will finance opioid-deprivation research and treatments. The pain-stricken states will collect sales tax. Thats a win-win situationdwindling revenue, decreased enforcement, and curbing policy changesa win-win strategy for the drug companies.\\nThe Cleveland Clinic, the opioid industrys largest, was one of the few big drug companies to profit from the legalization of marijuana. Its in discussions with cannabis-state attorneys, where we expect future drug cases to move faster. The NCIB has taken a 6-month hold and will keep legal marijuana off the shelves until 2027. It will be sold to medical dispensaries.\\nAcute marijuana-related addiction and fatal opioid overdose have spawned a major intersection of industry. One drug specialist predicts an actual wave of opioid-related medical research that will yield revenue of $132 billion.\\nIndustry transparency about drug policy will be a key enabler. Insurers typically receive more than half of all investigations by insurance companies with more than 300 doctors, researchers, and hospitals. Many cancer cancers are recorded by doctors. Other cancerssurgery, hemorrhoids, lung cancer, and prostate cancerare quantified by providers using medical imaging. But the National Cancer Institute has the biggest database of cancer patientsstate and federal policies, cancer sites, and emergency care providersand insurers often do the bulk of the work for drug companies.\\nHopefully, we will soon see more of these innovations.\\nDisproportionately, our nations medical-quality services actually increase after legalization. The per-patient cost of fighting addiction can increase as well as the quality of life of millions of people with multiple partners and families in need of the treatment they need. According to Pew Research Center, the cost of treating a long-term opioid dependence declined 6.8 percent between 1990 and 2012, the sharpest decline in the surveys seven-year history.\\nOregon and Washington are among several other states with access to pharmaceutical services and research to tackle addiction, while Virginia, New Jersey, Nevada, and Pennsylvania all have legislation in place that has resulted in a significant increase in medical revenue.\\nAs DCist suggests, success in the states medical research and treatment development looks like it could take decades to be realized. Drug companies already have an opportunity to reduce the health care burden on American families. Consumers could select a drug, and the drug would then be available to people at no cost to them. This would undoubtedly benefit people in real need.\\nScaling the opioid market to legal sales could be the key factor in DCists thesis. Despite its opioid-related clinical expertise, this research could be upended by smart policy designs and smarter medical education. We already have a do-not-serve policy in place. And insurers could focus their medical services on researching the broadest possible drug.\\nWe should know by January 14 that Oregon and Washington have legalized recreational marijuana.\\n': '291020230455.txt',\n",

Scott has said he\\'s not philosophically opposed to marijuana legalization but has concerns about public safety, children\\'s health and how to measure impaired drivers. Under the legislation, small amounts of marijuana would have been legal to possess and grow for anyone over age 21. Eight other states, plus the District of Columbia, have legalized recreational marijuana. Vermont would have been the first state to legalize marijuana by vote of a state legislative body.

       "             'Follow @NirajC Cloned marijuana plants at the Sea of Green Farms growing facility in Seattle. (Jason Redmond/Reuters) Update, 11:45 a.m.: The transcript below has been updated with follow-up comments from Kleiman to provide further clarity on his views. Legal sales of recreational marijuana begin in Washington state Tuesday, just seven months afterpot went on salein Colorado. The two states are the first in the nation to regulate and allow sales of the drug for recreational use and, despite their differences, bothregulate the new industry inbroadly similar ways. Taxes are higher in Washington than in Colorado, and Colorado residents may grow limited amounts at home while Washingtonians cannot. But the differences are of degree, not kind: Both allowprivatesalesof the drug whilelimiting the amount purchased per transaction and imposing relatively high taxes. But thats not the only way to regulate marijuana. To get one perspective on an alternative, we spoke with Mark Kleiman , a professor of public policy at the University of CaliforniaatLos Angeles . Kleiman specializes in, among other things, drug policy and hiscompany, BOTEC Analysis, provided technical advice toWashington state regulators as they began creating rules for the new industry. Although his is just one view, itsan informed and prominent onein the market of ideas. What follows is an edited version of our interview discussing Washingtons systemand Kleimans views on how marijuana should, in an ideal world, be regulated. (Although BOTEC maintains acontract with the state, Kleiman notes he is free to discuss the states regulations.) Question: Whats your take on the way Washingtons regulations have beenrolled out? Kleiman: There were lots of choices made in the law in Washington that were not the choices I would have made. But then I didnt have to persuade 50 percent, plus one, of the voters to go for it. So thats where the Washington State Liquor Control Board [which is assigned the responsibility to regulate pot] was starting from and, within those constraints, I think their choices were reasonable, by and large. I pushed hard for delivery as an option. That was a fight they fought and won around liquor and didnt want to revisit for cannabis. I would have pushed for much tighter marketing restrictions than their lawyers said they were allowed to get away with. I would have had price as an explicit target of policy. The main question is how quickly does production capacity get built out to facilitate the price drop that Im sure is coming. And then what does the state do to deal with the price drop. I would strongly argue that preventing a price drop is a major policy objective.

Warren) Q: The counterargument there is that it might be overly burdensome on the heavy users. K: Yes, yes, thats a particular worry. Well, then you ought to make a lot of treatment available. If theres a group of people who smokes a lot and wont stop due to high prices, then you have to ask whether the impoverishment is justified. But even if theyre spending a lot of money, theyre probably smoking less pot than they would be if it were cheaper. And whether theyre net ahead or net behind is hard to tell. The people who are ahead are the people who would have been in that category but arent because its moreexpensive. Q: Interesting. Well, absent political considerations, what does your ideal system look like? K: My ideal system would have it legal nationally or at least have it illegal nationally but with an exception for some states. If they were allowed to do it fully legally, then I would have pressed for state stores. That seems to be a pretty clear choice. [posttv url=\"\" ] Q: Why is that? K: Because you can do state stores or you can do not-for profits. But if you have for-profit retailers, you have retailers devoted to selling as much product as they can. And, with respect to cannabis, thats not the public objective. The public objective is to have the material available to adults who want to use it responsibly while minimizing the increase of drug abuse and access to minors. The commercial industry does not have those objectives, theyre dependent on the dependentusers. The free market is an excellent system for maximizing consumption. Thats why I dont want it to apply to this product. I wouldnt want that systemforalcohol either, but we lost that battle. I propose the following system: If you want to buy one of those commodities, you should sign up as a buyer, you should probably take some kind of minimal test like a driving test to make sure you know what youre talking about and then you should be asked to set for yourself a purchase quote on, say, a monthly basis. How many joint-equivalents a month do you want to use? Give us a number. Every time you make a purchase, that purchase will be recorded against that quota. And if you bought as much this month as you said you wanted to be able to buy this month, the clerk will say Im sorry the order was refused. Justwhat happens whenyou go over yourcredit card limit. Its the sameprinciple. Now, some people will just set a very high quota to start with, in which case the system will not matter at all to them. Other people will set a low quota, hit it and and say Oh, that was a mistake, and immediately go to a high quota, so it wouldnt do them much good. (Though, if you require a two-week delay to change your quota, youd at least slow them down.) And some people would set a low quota and never hit it, so it wouldnt matter. But some people would set a lower quota and hit it sometime early in the month and say to themselves Hmm, I guess I didnt know I was using that much and not reset it. Andthoseare the people who would obviously benefit from the system. Now, I dont know how many there would be, but its hard to see who would be harmed by this system. A pamphlet at the Cannabis City recreational marijuana shop in Seattle. The store will be the first and only store in Seattle to sell recreational marijuana when legal sales begin on Tuesday. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) Q: Is this based on some psychological principle? K: Its based on Schellings ideas about self-command . Its based on an idea about substance abuse and other bad habits, which is that they are essentially a time-mismatch problem. The reward is now, the cost is later. And none of us are very good about that. Schelling tells a story in one of his essays, about a company I think its a real case which is worried about weight gain among its executives. [Retold here, on page 81 , with citation.] So they changed the policy in the executive dining room so that you had to order lunch at 9:30 in the morning. People consumed fewer calories ordering when they werent hungry. Look, these guys werent stupid. It wasnt hard to figure out, at least after the first time, that at 12:30 you were going to want the chocolate cake that you werent ordering at 9:30. But at 9:30 you didnt want it and you actually didnt want the 12:30 self to have it. And so people lost weight. The thing in the literature this links to is the Thaler-Sunstein nudge idea. Youre changing the choice architecture. My essay on this in Washington Monthly was called A Nudge Toward Temperance . Again, I have no idea how much it would work and theres lots of design questions, but why the hell not? Wed like to nudge people not to use too much. Cannabis City owner James Lathrop gestures as he stands in the middle of his new marijuana shop days before the grand opening Wednesday, July 2, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) Q: So what are some of the looming questions that have to be answered? K: The questions remaining to be answered are: How fast are prices going to move? What happens to the nature of demand in the market? Does the tendency toward wanting the highest THC reverse now that THCs no longer scarce? Does the tendency toward edibles and concentrate continue? And, if so, do people learn to use those safely? Is dabbing a problem? [Dabbing is the process of inhaling flash-vaporized, concentrated hash oil.]What happens to juvenile use? Among the various ways of getting cannabis growing it yourself legally in Colorado, illegally in Washington, having it legally produced in state, having it illegally produced and brought in from out of state, getting it from a medical outlet, getting it from a commercial outlet or getting it diverted from a medical outlet what are the market shares of those things and how do they change over time? What happens to price, what happens to revenue? Whats the impact of legal cannabis on alcohol? Thats the big wild card. It turns out the two drugs are substitutes and the argument for legalization and keeping it cheap get to be pretty overwhelming.

       "             'at 9:36 AM Jeff Sessions, under fire from all sides. (Matt Rourke, Associated Press file photo) Former NFL player Marvin Washington is one of five plaintiffs who are suing Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Administration in federal court to legalize marijuana, the New York Post reported Monday night. Washington, a defensive lineman known mostly for his time with the New York Jets over his 11-year NFL career, is the co-founder of a company that sells hemp-based sports performance products that do not contain THC, the component of cannabis that causes a high in marijuana users . In the lawsuit, he claims that the federal government\\'s classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug in other words, a substance that has a high potential for abuse and one that has no accepted medical use prevents him from receiving federal grants to open a business that \"would allow pro football players to use medical marijuana for pain management in lieu of more addictive opioids,\" the Post reports. NFL players \" are fed opiates and pharmaceuticals throughout the week, from training camp until the end of season. That can be June to January. It\\'s not normal,\" Washington told the New York Daily News in June. \" I think the Players Association should demand that [players] have an alternative to opiates. This is scientific-based. This is not hocus pocus. That\\'s where I want to see this in the very near future, players that have an alternative to opiates.\" As delineated by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA), substances such as marijuana, heroin and LSD are considered Schedule I drugs but drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine are considered less dangerous Schedule II drugs because, while also addictive and subject to abuse, they have accepted medical uses in the eyes of the federal government. \"The record makes clear that the CSA doesn\\'t make any rational sense and the federal government knows it,\" attorney Michael Hiller, who represents Washington and the other plaintiffs in the lawsuit, told the New York Post. Joining Washington as plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Alexis Bortell , an 11-year-old girl who needs medical marijuana to treat her epilepsy, and Jose Belen, a disabled military veteran who uses marijuana to treat his post traumatic stress syndrome.

       "             'Federal prosecutors have launched a new anti-drug initiative this week called the Stop and Frisk program in five Washington, D.C. cities: cities with no zoning limits for outdoor recreational activities, the District, Yorktown, Matadors, and Kasold.\\nThe district plans to use stop-and-frisk tactics to curb youth drug crimes, but it has focused efforts in other cities since 2011. After the decline of heroin and prescription drug abuse, efforts in cities dealing with drug offenses have started to improve, said spokesman Tad Waite in an email.\\nNine new districts have been chosen to participate in the new initiative, including Washington. The district includes Arlington, Northern District, and Stuyvesant Town, while all 10 cities will be joined by all others.\\nIts kind of a coordinated effort that mirrors what cities have done in other regions, said Sarah Bajarin, a spokeswoman for the Districts Attorney Generals Office. The objective of the Stop and Frisk program is to disrupt violent drug offenses in the District.\\nThe District also made the decision to hire civilians in various agencies to run the program, such as the Law Enforcement Preparedness Center and the Sexual Assault Task Force.\\nThe program will be started by hiring civilians, including the more experienced investigators and supporting staff. Unlike in other cities where cops only recruit civilians, we were not interested in coaching and training them, so we simply recruited civilians that did not have the experience, Bajarin said. Ultimately, this is a collective effort among law enforcement agencies to improve the quality of life for our citizens.\\nThe program was designed and coordinated by the Police Protective League of Americas Stop and Frisk Task Force, a collaborative-organization group of D.C. police officers, law enforcement public safety officials, and young people involved in police operations across the United States.

The 28,500-square-foot property at the corner of California and Glendale boulevards in Edgewood Hills will be larger than Oklahoma Citys Cattle Co., and will include mountain-facing oaks and sawgrass cacti.\\nThe ranch, which will include 16 miles of roads and 700 acres of amenities, is one of the first sites Tyson has planned for cannabis, an area under cultivation in a little-known state. Tyson was the seventh richest person in California, according to Forbes, but more than half of those residents are illegal immigrants.\\nWyshak and his firm, Garden of Agencies LLC, did extensive research to study the hard-to-prove population of California marijuana households. He said 60 percent of its clients are illegal immigrants or residents of Mexico and other countries with a Latin American eye for the poor and oppressed. The residents of Cabo San Lucas were the number one or two groups that Tyson monitored  without even having their names attached.\\nIf you put $30,000 dollars into 10 families, the residents are actually less expensive than the adults, Wyshak said. I brought two children out to their homes to look around the place.\\nWyshak said he first heard of the Discovery ranch from a tour of a zoo in 2017. Since then, it has grown from 12 acres into 7,700 acres. He estimates its owner to be worth $150 million.\\nLike this report?

That violates other federal laws, too.\\nWhat\\'s happened to religious freedom?\\nSame old, same old.\\nLast week, New York judge Ann Levine threw out a lawsuit brought by two religious people claiming that at least some members of the church group that founded the sect did not deserve church assistance in its investigation of whether the sect inappropriately obtained confessions by having sex with underage boys.\\nLast year, Levine set aside a $40,000 fine imposed by the city to fight the case, which the Justice Department dismissed as baseless. In a brief judgment, Levine ruled that at least two leaders of the church group, Craig Block and Hall Williams, know that they have the right to access church funds.\\nLevine said neither Block nor Williams are in violation of the federal restriction on church income. Block, a Bush appointee, has applied his First Amendment rights to obtain special housing for eight of his 14 teenage children. Williams, a mortgage salesman, has not.\\nSo what about the thousands of church people who have adopted the belief that church leaders had coerced at least one underage child into having sex with adults other than their own? A recent Associated Press article concluded that \"[t]he sort of squatty church has just the opposite of immunity for what it did.\"\\nThree years ago, when California lawmakers removed marijuana and booze from prescription medicines and allowed most pharmacists to prescribe them, 99 of the state\\'s 89 doctors accepted leniency on the part of cannabis and alcohol-withdrawal doctors.\\nUnder federal law, courts have the power to make nondiscrimination accommodations to defendants for allegations of church abuse. But the judiciary argues that both the federal and state governments should equally act to try to assure the religious exemption is denied to either church or nondiscrimination victims.\\nWell, in other words, with the exception of having arrestees present in court, the courts have the power to deny state agencies access to court records, they say.\\nUnited Methodist Church leaders believe that the church has a right to strip hospitals and the nation\\'s only public health agency of its impartiality. Their claims, which originally were denied at the state level, have been at the forefront of national debate, with more than 4,000 members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints doing so over the past 20 years.\\nIn a letter recently to the Washington Post, led by lawyer Paul A. Sutton of Sol E. Sutton & Co., the decision in Levine\\'s 2-week trial found that the government had no remedy to keep patients off the pill or off marijuana, including three state hospitals that do not maintain psychiatric wards.\\n\"No case has ever been made that the court has any discretion at all to impose any injunctions or sanctions on a private enterprise as to the rights and wrongs of that business,\" Sutton wrote.\\nWhat kind of protection do the courts have to a religion? They\\'re coming up with their own. Judge Levine seems to agree. A few weeks ago, Levine ruled that nobody should be discriminated against for speaking out in the legal fight against religious discrimination. Then, last fall, she admitted that the nation\\'s chief government agency had contemptuously allowed the resignation of its next chief executive.\\nIf Judge Levine were to roll over for the federal government, \"it would appear to me that the war on religion was totally on the mind of the federal government,\" says Alan Morissette, a professor of constitutional law at George Washington University.\\nMorissette makes the same argument about the government\\'s ability to muzzle religious freedom. \"There is no justification for for the federal government to even have an interest in attacking a publicly funded organization,\" he says. \"Nobody at the federal level in government will care about that.\"\\n': '291020230505.txt',\n",
       "             'When California\\'s Mendicino County publishes it annual farm production census this spring, agricultural Commissioner Ted Erickson will dutifully report that wine grapes are the county\\'s No. 1 crop. That\\'s not true, and Eriksen knows it. But the Mendicino Board of Supervisors and California state officials have ordered him not to report on the county\\'s most lucrative farm crop -- marijuana. Marijuana growing is a $100-million-a-year business in Mendicino, Eriksen estimates, so big it makes the county\\'s $20 million worth of grapes look like small potatoes. After years of ignoring illegal marijuana farming, Eriksen finally included the crop in his annual report last year. He might as well have lit a joint in the courthouse. There was such a flap that Eriksen had to tear the marijuana page out of every issue of his annual report and promise never to report on pot again. \"A lot of people feel that if you don\\'t mention it, it\\'ll go away,\" says Eriksen. \"The fact is that this is an illegal crop, but it has tremendous impact on the economy of Mendocino County.\" Mendocino is one of 17 northern California counties in which Marijuana farming has reached such a scale that federal agents have been sent in to try and stop it. Until recently the marijuana business was dominated by imports, primarily from Columbia. But while U.S. steel and automakers are pleading for protection from imports and the nation\\'s producers of shoes and television sets are strugglingto survive against foreign competition, the domestic pot industry is proving it can beat the imports. American Marijuana growers harvested a record crop last year, well over 1,000 metric tons of the illegal herb, federal authorities and private marijuana specialists estimate. Federal Drug Enforcement Administration statistics released a few days ago show U.S. marijuana production growing at a rate of better than 20 percent a year, while marijuana imports are up only about 13 percent. The agency estimates Americans smoked marijuana worth between $15.5 billion and $21.9 billion in 1979.Perhaps $2 billion to $3 billion worth was grown in the United States. By comparison, U.S. tobacco production was worth $17 billion that year. Once considered a youthful indulgence, marijuana has gained increasing acceptance among adults, the DEA said. Use of the drug by youths 12 to 17 is \"leveling off\" the agency reported, but \"there was an unexpected persistence in marijuana use between 1977 and 1979 among older adults (over 26) who used Marijuana in their youth.\" The rapid growth of marijuana cultivation has for the first time forced the DEA to switch some of its law enforcement effort from trying to stop smuggling and to concentrating on catching domestic producers. Commercial marijuana growing began in the United States only about five years ago, and already homegrown pot accounts for an estimated 7 percent to 10 percent of the 14,000 to 15,000 tons smoked each year. Measured in dollars, the domestic pot growers have captured an even bigger share of the market, because their product sells for two to 10 times as much as imported marijuana. As if they had taken a percentage lesson from Madison Avenue, U.S. marijuana farmers are cashing in by concentrating on the luxury market -- producing what even the DEA admits if the best marijuana available and charging premium prices for it. Domestic growers have used designer genitics to produce pot many times more potent than garden-variety grass. They\\'ve even given it what amounts to a brand name -- \"sinsemilla.\" The word is an amalgam of the two Spanish words meaning \"seedless\" but has come to imply champagne-quality homegrown marijuana. U.S. growers are getting $100 to to $200 an ounce for their sinsemilla, while Columbian grass sells for $40 or less. And because the channels of distribution are much shorter for American marijuana -- much of it is sold directly by the growers -- the domestic producers are making far greater profit. On an investment of $3,000 or less, a grower can easily produce a marijuana crop worth $100,000, says David Schickedanz, coordinator of the first federal effort to try to eradicate the infant industry before it gets any bigger. Between June and October of last year, local, state and federal agents participating in the DEA\\'s \"Operation Sinsemilla\" raided 740 pot plots, arrested 527 persons and seized 129,329 marijuana plants weighing more than a total of 220,000 pounds. Counting another ton of processed pot that was seized, the operation netted an estimated $131.5 million worth of marijuana. All the seizures and arrests were made in 17 norther California counties (including Mendocino) where serious marijuana growing apparently got its start and is the most prevalent. California and Hawaii are the leading marijuana growing states, reports the DEA. \"We\\'re not saying it\\'s just Claifornia and Hawaii,\" stressed Schickedanz. \"You\\'ll find it in every state that has a growing season long enough for vegetables. Anybody who can grow a tomato can grow marijuana. When the DEA began cracking down in northern California, growers moved over the border into Oregon. Arkansas is rapidly building a reputation as California\\'s rival, say officials of the national Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML). They contend marijuana is grown in every state and the District of Columbia, where much of it is cultivated indoors. Campaigning for the right to grow grass for personal consumption is the latest move for the group, which until now has stressed efforts to ease or erase criminal penalties for possession of small amounts. Only Alaska now permits people to grow their own grass, said George Farnham, the young lawyer who serves as a political director of NORMAL. In most states, growing marijuana is a far more serious crime than getting caught with an ounce or less. Many state laws treat cultivation of even a single marijuana plant with the same severity as selling drugs, imposing mandatory prison sentences. Farnhan says U.S. grass growers \"benefit the U.S. economy by keeping the money in the country instead of giving it to Columbia. It helps our balance of payments.\" Buying marijuana from a \"hippie farmer in Arkansas\" is better than getting it from a multinational smuggling ring, he argues. Government efforts to halt foreign marijuana production and smuggling, especially the spraying of the poison paraquat on marijuana fields, lead pot smokers to start growing their own, the NORML lawyer suggested. Fear of paraquat and the Mexican government\\'s success in curtailing marijuana cultivation have cut imports of the Mexican variety sharply, the DEA says. From 2,200 tons in 1978, Mexico\\'s supply to the U.S. fell to at most 1,500 tons in 1979. Imports of Jamaican \"ganga\" doubled, however, as troubles in the economy of that island nation lead more Jamaicans to turn to growing and smuggling. Colombia remains the main supplier, exporting an estimated 10,100 tons of marijuana to the United States in 1979. Smuggling has grown to such an organized level that twice in 1979 U.S. drug agents intercepted shipments of 50 tons of marijuana -- an entire shipload. Marijuana weed, also known as the hemp plant, was cultivated for rope in midwestern states during World War II and still grows wild in much of the country. But marijuana smokers learned long ago that wild weeds don\\'t have the desired impact. The plants are very low in cannabis resin and in tetrahydrocannabinol (Thc), the ingredient that makes users \"high.\" \"People used to look down their noses at homegrown,\" Farnham says, \"but now when you\\'re talking homegrown, you\\'re talking about the best marijuana in the world.\" American marijuana is considered more desirable, he explained, because growers have learned how to increase the THC content and grow a crop many times more potent than the imported variety. The most potent California marijuana contains as much as 6 percent pure THC, agreed DEA agent Schickedanz, while ordinary grass has as little as 0.05 percent of the psychoactive chemical. To make their stuff stronger, pot farmers plant a different variety. The marijuana grown in Mexico, Colombia and Jamaica and the wild weed in the United States is a plant called cannabis satavia. Another variety grows in Asia, cannabis indicia, containing much more resin. Americans in Vietnam developed a taste for the Eastern variety and brought the seeds home with them. But the secret of sinsemilla is in the growing. The cultivators emasculate their marijuana patches, culling out the male plants as soon as their sex can be determined. Struggling futiley to reproduce without males, the frustrated females pour all their energy into producing THC, because the sticky chemical helps trap pollen. The result is a monster marijuana plant -- 10 to 20 feet tall, vivid green, bushy as a Christmas tree and literally dripping with THC. DEA officials estimate that each sinsemilla plant will yield an average of a pound of pot, and some will produce two or even three pounds. Both DEA and NORML representatives agree that $1,000 a pound is the going price for sinsemilla in that quantity.The smoker who buys an ounce will probably pay $100 to $200 for it, pushing the value of a pound to $2,000 or $3,000. Government drug officials in the past have been accused of inflating the value of drugs to exaggerate their danger. But DEA estimates of sinsemilla output are based on the one-pound-to-the-plant, $1,000-a-pound rule, and NORML officials say the government numbers are, if anything, on the low side. But the pro- and antimarijuana forces disagree on other aspects of marijuana growing. The people who want to legalize pot describe a cottage industry right out of \"The Greening of America\" with friendly folks who, as Farnham puts it, \"grow a little grass for themselves and their friends.\" DEA talks of marijuana millionaires, pot plantations and staggering profits. A single sensimilla plant will yield 1,500 hand-rolled joints of marijuana too potent for most smokers to consume by themselves. \"One plant is enough to keep somebody stoned out of their mind for a year,\" said Schickedanz. Each plant requires a plot about three feet in diameter, so a moderate-sized garden will produce 100 plants yielding $100,000 worth of sinsemilla, the DEA agent noted. The biggest grower busted by the DEA in its California raids had 7,200 plants, worth at least $7 million. With a crop that valuable, the growers don\\'t just throw their seeds in the ground and wait for the harvest, Schickendanz said. About this time of year they start the seeds in individual planting pots, just like tomatoes or cabbages. In the spring, the seedlings are transplanted outside. (Urban growers often produce pot in a closet, using fancy lighting systems that produce the wavelengths the plants prefer.) Deer, rabbits and other garden pests love the leafy marijuana plants, so most of the serious growers fence their plots with chicken wire or woven wire fencing. To keep out burrowing creatures, they extend the wire underground, and to keep out poachers, more than a few plots have burglar alarms. Schickedanz said one of the California growers his group caught last year had installed two above-ground swimming pools to hold water and liquid fertilizer for his marijuana garden. \"He\\'d hooked up a couple of pumps. All he had to do was step out of his cabin and hit a switch, the first pump would run until the plants got their water, then shut off automatically. Then a second pump would give them the fertilizer.\" The DEA agent estimates \"Operation Sinsemilla\" wiped out 20 percent to 40 percent of the marijuana crop in northern California last year. But, he admitted reluctantly, \"I personally don\\'t think we\\'ll ever stop it.\"': '091120113028.txt',\n",

Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) told the Loop Tuesday he surprised some colleagues when he told them he was the author of a new marijuana bill, but he hopes having a Republican at the helm will make people take another look at it. Its not a new position for Griffith, who staked this position as Majority Leader in the Virginia legislature, and even drafted legislation in 2010 that swiftly died in the House of Delegates. Now as a member of Congress, Griffith has taken this libertarian view to a larger stage, introducing LUMMA, the Legitimate Use of Medicinal Marijuana Act. Griffiths bill would ensure states could make their own decisions about medical marijuana usage without the federal government stepping in. His bill would also reclassify marijuana under the Justice Departments controlled substances lists, so the drug wouldnt be linked with harder drugs, such as heroin. I am saying if we can use [opioids], why the fear of using [marijuana] for legit medicinal purpose? Griffith said. Public support for medical marijuana use is overwhelming. A CNN/ORC poll in January found 88 percent of American adults supports legalizing the drug for medical reasons. Griffith still thinks legalizing marijuana fully, so just anyone can go down to Billy Bobs marijuana shop, is irresponsible, he said. But there has also been a sea change in public opinion on legalizing marijuana for recreational use, as Colorado and Washington state did. A Pew Research Center study in February found 54 percent support making the drug legal, compared with 2010 when 41 percent supported marijuana legalization.': '091120113024.txt',\n",

It has been long since made into a film and it features a lot of interesting things — but there have been other bizarre stuff in the book.\\nFrom PewDiePie (a World Championship Wrestling commentator, for example) to The Beer Sheets, Samir Bachadi has a massive list of stuff under the tree.\\nWhen will you get out of that drinking path? We love grocery shopping, but there are very good reasons why you can get that out of you.\\nWe're in the age of binge drinking. It means that at least some people will go out and spend at least two or three nights in bed and then have a brief binge (that is, you don't have to stop to eat again), but half of them will not be off it for six or seven nights. It is still very satisfying. But it's harder than it has ever been. Here are some of the mindboggling effects people have to deal with:\\nBeing in prison or the like\\nGetting stitches while being in a hospital; treating domestic violence and harassment.\\nMissing or experiencing mental health issues\\nBeing upset or having guilt over how busy it's getting (and how hard it is to go out alone, for instance).\\nSomeone suffering with a family history of mental illness, whether they're close to the end of their career or died of a mental illness.\\nTreating\\nFamilies and friends who have suffered stress, anxiety, stress, trouble sleeping and got a sense of rest.\\nHigh-risk individuals taking prescription medications\\nPersons who have been diagnosed with a mental health condition.\\nGetting drunk\\nHaving too much s**t at night\\nIn January, the stress that comes with trying to quit after failing to pay your own bills.\\nDeclining emotions or being depressed\": '030920174446.txt',\n",

There are innumerable examples of heroes and villains and greater strength than anyone can fathom.\\nLooking through figures, people and publications, we know that if a politician got caught making out with cocaine in a bin it would go to prison for a relatively long time. We recognise that this is not exactly the case in Britain. The scale of mass incarceration in Britain today serves only to increase the probability that people will be locked up for life.\\nWe know that many London politicians – including those with vision for change – think of James Bond taking a ride in a car on the back of a pickup truck, because they would like to get their message across to those on the edge.\\nWe also know that if this \"progress\" appears to have failed in a determined attempt to prevent crime it will not, with many depressed and frustrated people, put off in the belief that a meaningful crackdown is not necessary.\\nHowever, this would be a fool\\'s errand if people continue to hold on to their convictions despite the consequences. We also need a regulatory and law-enforcement system that respect the conscience of the populace and rather than endlessly stirring up resentment we must learn lessons for other countries.\\nWe have a right to see and experience more of the increased public scrutiny as they increasingly view themselves and their lives as targets, especially when we already have a couple of electoral elections before Christmas where enormous polarization is likely to affect the outcome.\\nThere are plenty of \"political prisoners\" but a large proportion are mostly inmates already, so an extra year would almost certainly be enough to get them to the front door. Like many of us we would expect to see fewer criminals locked up for life but we don\\'t, so we have a right to make sure offenders are completely exempt from the societal sentencing commission.\\nWe already see that there are a few cases where judges have allowed - and certainly argued - an additional 12 months of imprisonment. We would also be more than happy to see that there are serious cases being recorded so that courts actually recognise their offenders aren\\'t organised gang members but simply terrorising the community, not wishing to raise crime levels.\\nWhile this will not work as much as many initially thought, there would be a new minimum set of laws and studies that will hopefully allow the perpetrator to be held for longer than his or her \"second-hand\" slumming and planned robbery.\\n\"There may be other reasons that have been suggested for sentencing which include the societal improvements that have occurred, the numerous films relating to modern criminality, the increased security resources we have and the fact that we have grown up in communities with mass destruction,\" writes Time Books in a helpful reading.\\nWith this more and more people constantly on the fringes of society, it will make it even harder for us to ensure that we don\\'t get into the wrong cells. Who knows what would happen after such a high proportion of crimes go unsolved.\\nThe changes we think we are capable of doing to our society have been popularised and popularised by lots of politicians, so it is likely that this time we are in for a significant backlash in our eyes. A lot of what we think of as being \"good\" politicians have had a higher productivity than criminals have.\\nThese changes would obviously require a lot of these things. Perhaps the only catalyst to help to remove this delusion is a national prison regime which will inevitably have to be weeded out in the future.\\nThe verdict is by no means unanimous. We cannot pretend to understand more of the legal issues behind those riots in Blackberry Plc than we are prepared to admit.': '030920174440.txt',\n",

In a conversation which Mark Victor Dixon gave a leadership and leadership change, the presidential candidate lectured us both on our perfectly predictable take-off-the-tube-code era of the 2007-08 Great Recession, in which a number of patterns crunched on the part of big oil and gas companies led to a dramatic pullback in oil production.\\nThe \"climax\" describes the industry\\'s dreadful record of response to this disaster; Mr obama apologists claimed that it was up to Mr Texas to work out how to get oil rigs back to the ground. In their persuasive eloquence, we dodged Mr America.\\nAs we say in our voices, everything else is linked to third parties, made up of casinos, tech giants and wealthy billionaires. There is no index to which there can be any independent evidence showing that money lenders and big business are not orchestrating the transformation of the United States into a cartel of Big Oil or technology billionaires, or that government policies at the companies level are hiding the shady practices of industry lobbyists. People are working hard to resolve this generational conflict. It\\'s an open secret, and a lot of it is done by Mr Obama\\'s Democratic presidential campaign.\\nMr Hugo Chavez (translated by Matthew Levitt)\\nAccording to the press, Mr Obama and his co-leadershave each \"lost hundreds of billions\" from the hardwood boom, and to that end, oil production is flat. In the current climate, Mr Obama and his visiting Chinese counterpart should sign away our stewardship of our energy supply and support the export of America\\'s foreign oil, especially in the face of threats to its security from highly oil-rich regimes like Libya and Saudi Arabia. We cannot keep a laughing stock for the entire Obama administration, which has spent enormous sums trying to tear apart the old Chevron fortune and impoverish the poorest in the United States.\\nGlobally, Americans now stand to lose over £40bn a year from the warming of the planet, on average going to see the starting point of a decade of dangerous climate change and diseases that are causing our children and their babies to have devastating, devastating health problems. On a global scale, people will lose $10tn between 2007 and 2040. The climate is going to change now, and huge amounts of it is happening to our own families and the planet in what is shaping up to be one of the greatest economic ever recorded.\\nAccording to the UN\\'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), humanity\\'s climate change was supposed to be so fatal that it will cause catastrophe because of its cumulative impact, created by rising temperatures, increasing storms, intensifying droughts and earthquakes and predicted increases in sea level and other like impacts. An estimate of every global person\\'s losses came to us in 2008. To lose $40bn could mean you lose the top three nationals on the planet: humans, cyclones and hurricanes.\\nOn an average, climate impact is estimated to cost the world a third less than those in 1945. Two billion people worldwide were killed by sea level rise during that period, costing about half a trillion dollars a year.\\nTwo billion is the range of greenhouse gases projected to cause global climate change by the end of the century, so everyone makes a profit in the same way. By 2050, probably not a terrible year to live in this country; people will see their diminishing incomes eroded, their rates of life expectancy will decrease, their diets will decline and their muscles will shrink. This is the catastrophic collapse of health and the threat of death which is predicted to have destroyed the U.S. military force in Afghanistan – already due to exceed its budget next year. And while environmental damage is the top-of-the-pack category when it comes to health, the devastation in Afghanistan and elsewhere must be acted upon to save our soil and our clean water. The Obama administration should adopt a climate change plan, and identify measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and start an innovative phase-out of a fossil fuel economy.\\nThe decision was made last week by the US Congress, and it is not the last, but if China\\'s citizens, the world\\'s biggest oil exporter, decide to protest the Barack Obama administration, that story may not end well. The US needs to lead by example, not by flamboyant caricatures.': '030920174438.txt',\n",

The umbilical cord connects the mother to her childs umbilical cord. It is said that the childs umbilical cord becomes almost severed when the other part of the umbilical cord has been severed. Pushing the cord can make the child prone to his or her own blood clots that can survive in the blood-splattered shell of his or her body. The umbilical cord is being taken out. An eardrum hemorrhage occurs when a red substance of blood starts coming out of the outer layer of the babys chest, a cause that will allow the skin to thicken more quickly and needlessly.

       "             'On August 31, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the ban on gun sales to marijuana card holders is constitutional. The lawsuit was filed by S. Rowan Wilson, a Nevada resident who was denied a firearm purchase in 2011 after obtaining a medical marijuana card. According to the Associated Press, the gun store told Wilson she could not purchase the gun because of a federal law barring marijuana card holders from purchasing firearms. Although some states have legalized marijuanawhether for recreational use or as a medical aidethe drug remains illegal on the federal level. And the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has told gun sellers they can assume a person with a medical marijuana card uses the drug, which means they cannot pass a federal background check for a gun purchase. Form 4473 of the background check process asks if the would-be firearm purchaser is an unlawful user ofmarijuana. No one who answers yes to that question can purchase a gun. The Ninth Circuit panel ruled unanimously in favor of the gun ban.

       "             'Less than a year after Massachusetts voters approved legalizing marijuana and taxing it at a rate of 12 percent, lawmakers already seek a larger take of the dealers cut. In shifting marijuana from decriminalized to legal status, voters permitted a maximum tax of 12 percent on sales of the sweet leaf. Seven months later, the state legislature seeks to grab more of pot profits by permitting taxes as high as 28 percent. Its not as though those in the reefer business didnt see the state coming for their business. Nine years ago, I sat down with two longtime pot dealers in the Beacon Hill Pub a short walk from where the Great and General Court does business. The sixtysomething sinsemilla sectaries viewed legalization as a way to corporatize a mom-and-pop enterprise. Should it be legal? Yes. Do we want it legal? No, declared cue-balled Charlie, dealing for decades within eyeshot of the state capitol. Mark, sporting a Pancho Villa mustache, informed, Every time I go over to Hempfest, I chant: Keep Marijuana Illegal. At the time, a pot legalization proposal sought to impose a $150-an-ounce tax on the low-grade marijuana most commonly bought and smoked. In effect, the proposal aimed to double the price of a joint. This go-around, the proposed law allows for an end-around on the taxes by smokers using medical marijuana, which the bill exempts from the proposed taxation. If you had to pay the licensing fee, it wouldnt necessarily be cost prohibitive, Mark explained. But with the taxes, your clientele is going to disappear. A lot of people would just balk at paying that. Apart from raising taxes, the 48-page omnibus bill currently before the Great and General Court seeks to expand a cannabis board to five members, prohibit localities from enforcing laws against the transportation or delivery of pot, maintain a database on people using medical marijuana, and seize weed from those, such as Charlie and Mark, not given the states imprimatur to sell. The proposed law authorizes investigations and audits of the pot dispensaries. It imposes stringent testing on the product. And it directs the authorized marijuana dealers to abide by an affirmative action program in hiring. For pot dealers not keen on turning over their profits to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or eager to undergo annual audits, the law establishes a division of cannabis enforcement in the attorney generals office regarding a product that voters just legalized and long ago decriminalized. Ironically, veteran dealers such as Mark and Charlie face a government more eager to put them out of business now than when they peddled an illegal product as consumers may boost their business by more enthusiastically turning to their cheaper, black-market pot. The more than 54 percent who voted to legalize marijuana in Novembers election authorized a tax of no more than 12 percent. The 28 percent tax represents a 133 percent increase over the initial rate.

(REUTERS/Tony Amendola)\\nWhen gun-handling Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham introduced a bill in 2015 to nearly double marijuana taxes, she was immediately hit with criticism from the powerful members of her own party.\\nBut Grisham is now getting a bigger push from congressional members, leading to a lawsuit against the Treasury Department claiming to be aware of her bill before it went up for consideration this past weekend.\\nThe complaint alleges that government officials at the department had no idea Grisham was considering imposing a felony felony draconian regulation of marijuana possession until the bill passed into law. In fact, the department sought to jeopardize the Controlled Substances Act with a federal tax on high-levels of marijuana.\\nAccording to the complaint, that decision ultimately led to the expiration of the federal securities and options regulations (CSA). The proposals were developed by the DEA and DOJ, and the funds involved in the CSA contained administrative options the agencies could not agree on.\\nWhen a drug trafficking ring smuggled multiple high-level illegal marijuana deliveries across the nation, the DEA created an impounded vehicle that laundered the haul into U.S. currency to import the drugs.\\nThe DEA also altered the U.S. Visa Directive to prohibit marijuana use, affecting certain groups, such as Muslims and Jews.\\nSince taking office, Lujan Grisham made several attempts to address gun violence in Congress. The first was a bill that a handful of congressmen passed and quickly passed out of committee. Because she was concerned about the threat of skyrocketing gun prices, she sought to double up the bill with state income tax rates, saying she would double them and increase their $10 contribution rates.\\nAlthough the bill did come in as a result of her legislative push, there have been also several federal laws passed with the support of the president and first lady. As many as one of these bills might sound a bit less outrageous than it actually is.\\nBut the marijuana draconian crackdown in particular makes even supporters of the congressional marijuana bill difficult to stomach.\\nThe cannabis industry is divided on whether its business model is sufficient for the use of marijuana. Republicans and Democrats alike say it doesnt violate laws or tax revenue. Illegally using marijuana for medical purposes may also create some legal problems.\\nI dont think theres anything inherently wrong with it, but the people who are actually directly affected by it are people who are in the oil business and the price of it is whats charged to their customers. This isnt a textbook example of the kind of sort of backward thinking I think we should be thinking about, James Cannon, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, told the New York Times.\\nBut Cannon described the marijuana industry as a gigantic gambling business, with its own drug-sorting laws, that supports people who are putting their lives on the line.\\nThe suit also charges that the new marijuana laws placed a burden on all of us who are doing the enforcement of our rights.\\nWe are now the governmental agents of the Republic and we are not doing the work you can expect to see during the Bush era, said Andrew Weissberg, a lawyer who was initially appointed as the acting director of the DEA in April, referring to the Bush administrations efforts to enshrine the influence of marijuana on federal law. We dont want to have to listen to the executive branch to focus on the federal welfare of those that are seeking to buy this drug.\\nWhile the lawsuit in the House is ongoing, it should be noted that the IRS was prepared to act in the first place.

       "             'A report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) finds the proportion of high school seniors who smoke marijuana is higher than the proportion that smokes cigarettes. According to the report, since 2010, the proportion of U.S. high school seniors who smoked pot during the preceding 30 days was 21.4 percent, while the proportion that smoked cigarettes was 19.2 percent. CDC indicates it analyzed data from the 19972013 national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS) among U.S. white, black, and Hispanic students in grades 912 to study patterns in the use of cigarette, cigar, and marijuana smoking. According to the study, from 1997 to 2013, a 64% percent decrease was observed in the percentage of U.S. white, black, and Hispanic high school students overall who smoked cigarettes or cigars exclusively. Also, among white students, any cigarette, cigar, or marijuana smoking declined during the study period. CDC continues: Among black and Hispanic students, any cigarette, cigar, or marijuana use decreased from 1997 to 2007, but increased among black students from 2007 to 2013, and did not change for Hispanics from 2007 to 2013. Moreover, the percentage of white, black, and Hispanic students overall who were exclusive marijuana users more than doubled, and marijuana use among cigarette or cigar users also increased, with substantial increases identified among black and Hispanic students toward the end of the study period. The results show, says CDC, that whatever strides have been made in adolescent health due to lower cigarette and cigar use might be attenuated by increases in marijuana use, which vary by racial/ethnic subgroup. Increased exclusive marijuana use and use of marijuana among cigarette or cigar users could undermine success in reducing tobacco use among youths, CDC states. Closer collaboration between public health professionals to address prevention of tobacco and marijuana use might be beneficial in the development of evidence-based policies and programs to prevent tobacco and marijuana use. The study comes as more states and nations are considering relaxing laws about marijuana use or even legalizing its use entirely. According to Dr. Christopher Hammond, writing at Psychiatric Times last December, [T]he effects of marijuana use during adolescence and possible short- and long-term consequences are a growing concern. Hammond writes: Converging scientific evidence from preclinical studies, human neuroimaging, and large longitudinal studies suggests that adolescent-onset marijuana use, particularly heavy marijuana use, is associated with a number of neuropsychiatric sequelae including neurocognitive deficits and reductions in IQ, increased risk for psychosis, affective disorders, marijuana and non-marijuana drug addiction, and lower academic attainment. Also at Psychiatric Times, Dr. Robin Murray warns, Psychological dependence and tolerance can occur with cannabis. It remains in the body for several weeks, so withdrawal is very gradual but anxiety, insomnia, appetite disturbance, and depression can develop. Some reports claim that in 10% of persons who use cannabis and in 25% of daily users, dependence develops, Murray continues. Cannabis dependence is an increasingly common reason why patients seek help from drug treatment clinics. Murray observes that longitudinal studies conducted in Australia and New Zealand have found that daily marijuana use before age 17 was associated with clear reductions in the probability of graduating from high school and college. Those starting cannabis use early also appear more likely to develop cognitive impairment, Murray adds, noting that another study has shown that long-term heavy cannabis users who began smoking before age 17 had lower verbal IQ scores than those who began smoking at age 17 or older. Though the political trend is toward relaxing laws on marijuana, the outcome of a pattern in this direction is unknown. If legalization produces an increase in consumption, the impact on young teens  who are apparently most vulnerable to marijuanas harmful effects  remains a disturbing question.': '050121173519.txt',\n",

However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some individuals prefer to smoke marijuana at some point in their lives.\\nAccording to the David Brennan Center, among more than half of those polled who support legalizing marijuana, Less than half of respondents choose cannabis as a safe choice for several uses of the drug, including sexual intercourse. This apparently conservative figure is considerably less than half of those who support legalizing marijuana use, and more than half of those who dont.\\nWell, no one is 100 percent going to get prostate cancer. However, what the same poll found is that nearly 60 percent of those polled say they use cannabis for pain management and a growing body of evidence that marijuana has helped to reduce chronic pain and reduce incontinence, among others.\\nThe numbers are staggering. In fact, the UC Davis Medical Society conducted a study that said 50 percent of the majority of users from a medical marijuana clinic chose marijuana as a safe choice to relieve pain, reduce headaches, reduce episodes of chronic bladder or urethra dysfunction, as well as lower risk of cancer.\\nParticularly noteworthy for researchers was a survey found by the American Association of University Physicians to find that the percentage of those surveyed who said they use marijuana as a safe choice to relieve fatigue and pain, or an appropriate use of marijuana for a chronic pain solutiona search for i.e., why may your body work out, if marijuana helps it to relax, what happens when you dont get out of bed as easily as before and dont want to use it as often as you used to? was way way too low.\\nIt turns out that marijuana just isnt very effective at relieving pain or urinary symptoms. And it isnt all that effective for the poor, making it more expensive. In fact, a decade ago doctors recommended that regular treatments for minor pain and urinary symptom reliefsuch as antidepressants, acupuncture, and supplementsbe reserved for people with numerous chronic diseases.\\nSo the pediatricians of the American Academy of Pediatrics likely recommend only moderate to heavy marijuana use and not considered alternative treatment options, making the vast majority of users say they just wouldnt give up the tried and true.\\nStill, a growing number of physicians are increasingly concerned about the potential for doctors to prescribe marijuana as an effective alternative to pain medications.\\nThe National Institute on Drug Abuse released a report last year that said that 65 percent of patients who receive medical marijuana use its extremely limited safety and effectiveness, compared to only 19 percent of drug users. According to a 2013 study by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), among 70 million adults worldwide, medical marijuana may be the safest and most effective approach for treating treatment of chronic conditions and other mental health conditions.\\nThe study also found that 38 percent of the people with primary chronic pain may attempt marijuana, but they may develop short-term pain and difficulty concentrating and expressing emotions, according to a 2014 SAMHSA report.\\nIts a simple solution that could save even more lives, it seems, if it is legalized, according to pollster Dave Sonnenberg.\\nThis isnt going to be dealt with in terms of using the drug as a cure. There are three major dangers the legalization of marijuana poses, which is that its unsafe for medical purposes, he told LiveScience. If its legalized, there will be very limited access to marijuana.\\nSonnenberg added that its highly likely that, in the end, marijuana is one of the primary drugs used in treating depression and other mental health conditions.\\nFor most of our patients,  they have no doubt that they will get better, he told LiveScience. Were now talking about treating a devastating population of depressed individuals that, we know, will be dead by the time its legalized. So, once you have a marijuana product thats safe for use, maybe that will lead to better care for them. But in the meantime, we have to re-evaluate our own prescribing practices.\\n': '301120005456.txt',\n",

       "             'A common link between chili peppers and marijuana could have implications for how we treat diabetes and colitis, as well as other conditions in the digestive tract, according to a new study from the University of Connecticut. The study was published in the April 24 issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . Researchers say chemicals found in the peppers and marijuana interact with the same receptor in our stomachs. Scientists first focused on the chemical capsaicin, which is responsible for the hot sensation of eating a chili pepper. They fed capsaicin to mice, and found the mice fed with the spice had less inflammation in their guts. Heres a rundown of what happened next: When they looked carefully at what was happening at a molecular level, the researchers saw that the capsaicin was binding to a receptor called TRPV1, which is found on specialized cells throughout the gastrointestinal tract. When capsaicin binds to it, TRPV1 causes cells to make anandamide. Anandamide is a compound chemically akin to the cannabinoids in marijuana. It was the anandamide that caused the immune system to calm down. Knowing that the brain also has anandamide receptors, researchers began to imagine ways the immune system and the brain might talk to each other through the common language of the anandamide, explained Pramod Srivastava, professor of immunology and medicine at UConn School of Medicine. Researchers found that a greater presence of anandamide led to a greater presence of macrophages, immune cells that curb inflammation. The researchers actually managed to cure mice with Type 1 diabetes by feeding them chili peppers. When they skipped to feeding the mice anandamide directly, they observed a similar gut-calming result. Researchers want to head to Colorado, where pot is legal, so they can further study the effects of ingesting marijuana on anandamide in the body. Im hoping to work with the public health authority in Colorado to see if there has been an effect on the severity of colitis among regular users of edible weed, Srivastava said in a press release. The findings could have implications for various conditions found in the stomach, pancreas, intestines and colon.': '301120005443.txt',\n",
       "             'Medical marijuana usage is a hot topic today, but many of the politics behind regulation center around biased statistics. With various studies and exaggerated opinions, it is hard to determine what is true and what is utter bologna. I might not hold all the answers and have always been indifferent on the topic, but I do have some insight when it comes to positive experiences. One of my cousins had just graduated from an academy and, aside from myself and my weakening grandpa, all my family went out of state for the ceremony. My grandma asked if I could check on my grandpa while she was away. Reluctantly, I agreed to check on my grandpa to ease her worry. My grandpa, though I loved him, became a difficult person to be around. His old age and constant pain turned him into a grump, and he felt the need to tell others about his never-ending pain. It was not exactly a visit I was looking forward too. His agitated state became overbearing. People slowly distanced themselves from him, annoyed with his constant negativity. I, like most of my family members, took part in the distancing. Pretending everything was fine was easier, and remembering him as an active gardener was better than looking at the shell of himself he had become. But something had changed and I suddenly found myself face to face with a familiar stranger. Armed with a few subs for lunch and my two dogs, I slipped into the house and found my grandpa watching reruns of Walker Texas Ranger. Happy I was there, he struggled out of his brown recliner to hug me. When he noticed my puppies wagging their excited little poodle tails, he smiled. It had been a long time since that smile made an appearance, and the gesture warmed my heart. We made our way to the dining room table so I could put on his pain patch and we could eat. With only the sound of chewing breaking the silence, I began feeling awkward and desperate for a safe conversation topic. Searching my surroundings as if they held all the answers, I began looking for a flare of inspiration. My eyes landed on a tiny glass vial that contained only about a thimble worth of a crushed plant. I suddenly remembered my grandma telling me he had recently been prescribed medical marijuana. Taking the vial as a conversation saver and blessing in disguise, I asked him if the medical marijuana had been helping at all. Not surprisingly, he told me no, but a smirk curled his lips as he added, it gives me one hell of a high, though! He looked up at me with a glimmer in his eyes that had been missing for several years. The hollows of his face were less prominent, his eyes considerably less sunken, and an un-pained smile spread across his aged face. Believing the lively man sitting across from me was my grandpa was hard, but denying the positive effects of him smiling was impossible. The conversation sparked, and my grandpa proceeded to share with me the how-tos behind smoking. I continued to ask questions about the treatment, despite knowing very little about marijuana. This allowed my now enthused grandpa to keep the conversation going. Wrapped up in the moment, he asked if I wanted to try it with him. He continued by offering to show me how to smoke it from his pipe. Maybe he didnt realize what he was proposing, or he was just proud that he knew something I didnt. The reason didnt matter because it was the most excited I had seen him in years. I kindly declined his offer but let him describe each step in depth. I was a rookie that had never smoked, and I found it far too ironic that it was my grandpa of all people to offer me my first puff of marijuana. I knew he wanted me to try it with him, he probably thought it would be a bonding moment between us, but I preferred to remember corn picking and tractor riding as our thing. While he was telling me about his pipe, and the struggle of learning to use it through this foreign thing called YouTube, I reflected on how much he had changed. Though he still was in some pain, he was easier to be around. He discovered a piece of himself that was almost lost. We ended up enjoying our meal, and I was happy I listened to my grandma. Watching him feed the dogs lunchmeat made me smile at the magic I had witnessed. His new found zest for life could have come from the puppy-love therapy I offered, but I believed most of his recovery was related to the plant carcass he had been smoking. It wasnt a drug meant to get him high, and according to him it didnt help much in the pain department, but it unexpectedly gave my grandpa some of his lost spark. He had some life in him again, and I suspected it was a result from the munchies. His appetite returned, and he began moving around more with his returned strength. If I hadnt witnessed the magic first hand, I never would have believed the miracle that came from the marijuana.': '050121173315.txt',\n",
       "             'Pot is different from growing, distributing and selling potatoes, beef, salmon or cars, common commodities with of course complex forces at work. But cannabis takes complexity to a whole new level, comparable to tobacco and alcohol - which have been among the principal killers of Americans. Yet the US is ablaze with cannabis: It is our #1 illicit drug and medical marijuana (MJ) is legalized in 29 states and recreational marijuana legal in 8 states (DC permits both). 63% of Americans live in states with medical or recreational MJ or both. The flame is everywhere and picking up intensity. Over 22 million Americans (12 and older) reported using MJ in the past month . While some die-hards may imagine prohibiting the use of (especially) recreational marijuana and using law enforcement to make that happen that seems an extremely unlikely, not to mention a futile, path for this country. Informed and candid cops know that arrest and incarceration cannot solve problems of drug use and dependence. So we face questions like: Should cannabis be fully decriminalized? Should medical and recreational MJ be legalized in all states? Should production and sales be limited? Should the market be allowed its sway? If you as a state feel the heat and it is not if but when , what design logic would be a useful guide? Will it be individual freedom (for adults), free or regulated markets, or the health of the collective, as shaped by public health goals? Who will benefit therapeutically and financially? Who will suffer? What are the least worst options, given the well-known public health principle that increased access results in greater use? These questions are for your consideration as a citizen (and tax payer), consumer, parent, co-worker, business owner or state or federal official. We need to shine some light on a poorly lit set of data (mostly from when MJ was 1/60th as potent as it is today) and experience (which is not at all uniform or robust from the states having gone ahead) to make decisions now. The cannabis fire will rapidly outpace what science and practice may reveal in the years to come. To examine what we know and what we can do in a clear and sensible way a 3-day, National Cannabis Summit was held in Denver, CO, in late August, convened by three organizations. It was the brainchild of Neal Shifman, CEO of Advocates for Human Potential, a human services research, consulting and training organization. He joined forces with The National Council for Behavioral Health, constituted of 2900 member mental health and addictions treatment organizations, and the Addiction Technology Transfer Center Network, which promotes adoption and implementation of what works for people with Substance Use Disorders. Advocates for Human Potential 2017 National Cannabis Summit The conference smartly assembled a diverse group of government and private stakeholders. In practical ways, it crisply reported and discussed state implementation efforts to date, therapeutic effects and health risks of cannabis, legal and clinical knowledge, and the neuroscience of cannabinoids (the term for the class of diverse chemical compounds that act on our brain and body nerve receptors). Here are my take-away messages. Start small, as a state or county. Build slowly. There is no going back from full recreational legalization, especially when for-profit companies are financing its implementation. Imagine when Anheiser-Busch and RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company start promoting and distributing cannabis. Remember This Buds For You, The Marlboro Man and Joe Camel? Hence, also ban advertising. Separate out the growers from the distributors and those two from the retail sellers. Do not permit what is called vertical integration, where one entity controls the supply chain, which can foster monopoly. Pursue a harm reduction strategy, as Canada is doing nationally under its progressive Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. Identify and work to prevent or delay use by pregnant mothers or teenagers, where brains are under development. Add other highly vulnerable populations to that strategy, including those with known predispositions to or with family histories of a substance use or mental health disorder. Dont smoke cannabis. Vape or eat it: Smoking is really bad for the lungs. Decriminalize cannabis. Limit access. Make the minimal age 21, set limits of quantities for legal possession and number of home grown plants (which can become a black/grey market cottage industry), set limits on dosages because potency counts (e.g., 10 mg for edibles), require minimum prices so MJ does not become cheap (as it has in Washington State), and contain production quotas and retail outlets. Enforce the laws about Driving Under The Influence (DUI) and underage sales. Dont permit public consumption. Require childproof packaging. Ensure that cannabidiol (CBD) - the second most common cannabinoid in MJ after THC, and without psychoactive properties - is present in MJ products in significant amounts (we still dont know what that is but it is not near zero) because it appears protective against psychosis. Direct state (or federal, if that ever happens) cannabis taxes to fund health insurance, as well as prevention (especially for youth) and public information campaigns. Allocate a percentage of taxes to fund de-identified (i.e., privacy protected) state registries and use them to evaluate the impact of legalization on health and public safety - both for its therapeutic value and its harm to the brain and body (including diseases and traffic accidents). Get the FDA to declare cannabis a Schedule 2 drug, not its current hugely deterring Schedule 1 status, so our country can actually study this drug. Expect over 40% of current MJ users to ingest 20 or more days/month. Recognize that the predominance of regular users appears to stop on their own or not use abusively, without services (unassisted recovery see Dr. John Kelly, ). Ensure that those who need assistance, because cannabis is addictive, can access and continue in treatments known to work. Sustain or increase federal funding to study the effects and therapeutic potential of cannabinoids, including plant-based THC and CBD as well as the brains own cannabinoid system (driven by endocannabinoids). As citizens and policy makers we need to lean in to the dilemma of what to do about cannabis. Silence only lets a vocal minority rule. Like climate change, it is everyones issue, deniers notwithstanding. As a friend of mine recently wrote, A fool can throw a stone into the water that ten wise men cannot recover. (From Jay Neugeboren, March 2017). In other words, there is no single or simple solution to the cannabis Rubic cube. We will have to act now, and sensibly, and let science catch up. To paraphrase what Churchill said of we Americans, we do the right thing after we have exhausted everything else. Whats ahead is surely difficult but it is not impossible.': '301120005441.txt',\n",
       "             \"More than half of doctors think that medical marijuana should be legalized nationally, and two out of three doctors say patients should be given the medical option to use medical marijuana, according to a new survey. The survey was conducted by Medscape between Feb. 25 and March 3, and is based on answers from 1,544 physicians from 12 different specialty areas. Doctors in certain specialties seemed to better acknowledge the benefits of medical marijuana than others. Eighty-two percent of oncologists and hematologists, for instance, said patients can experience real benefits from medical marijuana; the same percentage of doctors in these two specialities also said they think patients should have medical marijuana as an option. In states where medical marijuana is not legal, about half of doctors surveyed said it should be made legal; the results were about the same in states still considering legalizing medical marijuana. However, more than half of doctors -- 53 percent -- did not support the legalization of recreational marijuana use. In a companion consumer survey conducted by WebMD , taken by 2,960 random visitors to the WebMD website between Feb. 23 and Feb. 26, the percentages in support of the legalization of medical marijuana were similar. Half supported its nationwide legalization, and for people living in states where it's not legalized, half said it should be made legal. Fifty-one percent of people from the WebMD survey said they do not support the legalization of recreational marijuana use.

       "             'President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, who has adopted as his signature policy a violent nationwide crackdown on drug use, claimed in remarks on Monday that he uses marijuana to stay awake. Duterte later told reporters he was of course joking, trying to keep a rambling speech about how much he disliked the experience of attending this years Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit from getting too boring. Duterte was speaking at an event celebrating the Philippine Organizing Committee that put together the countrys delegation to ASEAN. The Philippine president typically deviates from the main themes of events he attends in his remarks, instead taking time to discuss matters of interest to him, such as his distaste for the Catholic Church. Last week, he threatened to decapitate a Philippine bishop for allegedly buying drugs, a claim Duterte did not back with evidence. At the ASEAN event in Manila Monday, Duterte took the time to detail his many complaints about the conference, calling it a killing activity, implying that the world leaders who attend spend most of their time there slowly dying inside. Me, not so much, he added, because I take marijuana to stay awake. It doesnt work, with others. Duterte used Sultan of BruneiHassanal Bolkiah as an example of one of the world leaders who fell asleep during the event. Just between us, but Bolkiah slept during the events, Duterte said during the public speech at the presidential palace Monday. He has a talent to make it appear that he was not sleeping, so it is as if he is contemplating his oil. Duterte also complained about the awful food at the event, claiming he had to bring his own canned meats and eat them in his hotel room to avoid consuming catered ASEAN food for heads of state. The food sucked. Jesus, Mary,and Joseph, its true, Duterte protested. I have to bring Karne Norte and dried fish. He went on to complain that the heads of the ASEAN think were boy scouts and overbook each world leaders schedules. I cant take it, he added. The ASEAN conference occurred last month in Papua New Guinea. At the time, Duterte skipped several significant meetings at ASEAN and went on to skip four meetings scheduled at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in Singapore, which occurred immediately after the ASEAN summit. He also skipped the ASEAN gala, which he hosted in 2017 when the Philippines organized it. Dutertes presidential spokesman, Salvador Panelo, told reporters that Duterte skipped the meetings for power naps necessary due to the punishing schedule he faced. Dutertes remarks about marijuana have triggered the most outrage, as police have killed thousands of Philippine nationals in shootouts since Duterte took office in 2016, vowing to kill the nations drug criminals and eradicate illicit drug use entirely. Marijuana use is illegal in the Philippines. An estimated 5,000 people have died since Duterte took office in incidents related to law enforcement against drug crime. The first police convictions for wrongful killing of drug suspects occurred on Friday; Duterte has vowed to pardon officers who kill Philippine citizens suspected of using or trafficking in drugs. Asked to clarify his remarks Monday, Duterte said, Of course I was joking. I want to shake a tree in the middle of a [speech]. He added that his speech would be boring if he did not make jokes and that this was part of his style. Its too late to change, he concluded, adding, If you believe it, you are stupid. In an interview in 2016,Duterte issued support for legalizing medical marijuana, insisting that cannabis is really an ingredientof modern medicine now. There are medicines right now being developed or already in the market that contains marijuana as a component but used for medical purposes. Yet he rejected the idea of smoking cannabis recreationally, warning that those who fight the law by using it in the manner will die. Rappler added that Duterte has previously admitted , without claiming to be joking, to the use of fentanyl , an extremely addictive and dangerous opioid believed to have played a role in nearly half the opioid overdose deaths in the United States in 2017. Duterte claimed to use fentanyl in a patch form to relieve chronic back pain.': '050121173525.txt',\n",

It is becoming apparent that the Democratic Party wants to control Americans lives in every way but one: what to do with their bodies in any way that counters traditional morality. Whether its abortion on demand or legalizing drugs, the Democratic Party now represents a libertine hedonistic lifestyle which brooks no opposition and eschews personal responsibility. And this move by the Texas Democrats is more of the same.': '301120105817.txt',\n",

       "             'This isnt your average herb-infused drink. Nearly two months after recreational marijuana sales started in Washington , drinkable forms of the drug have hit store shelves. Produced by Washington-based company Mirth Provisions, an aptly titled beverage line called Legal is currently available at eight of the states 22 recreational marijuana stores , according to Fortune. The drinks come in five different flavors, including sparkling pomegranate and cold brew with milk and sugar. Though all Legal beverages are infused with 22 milligrams of THC -- \"enough to know that you\\'re high, but not so much as to overwhelm,\" Mirth Provisions founder Adam Stites told XXX -- each flavor touts a slightly different high. The high produced by the cold brew with milk and sugar , for example, is described on the companys website as an uplifting, euphoric head high and a gentle body buzz. Were particularly fond of the description for the sparkling lemon ginger flavor: Couch, meet butt. This delicious fusion of tangy lemon and spicy ginger is so ridiculously relaxing that you may find yourself becoming one with your furniture. Whether youre melting into a beach blanket or parked on the sofa, prepare for many glorious hours of doing absolutely nothing. Stites says \"drinkables\" dont carry as much of a taboo as other forms of marijuana. \" Its much more approachable , as opposed to Hey, mom and dad, do you want a joint?\\' Stites told Portland, Oregon, news outlet KGW-TV. Mirth Provisions had previously announced that the beverages would hit store shelves in July , but the company faced some minor setbacks that pushed back the product\\'s release date. Stites says his company has learned a lot from observing Colorado\\'s struggle with implementing recreational marijuana sales. \"Washington is learning from some of the challenges Colorado has seen, we\\'re slower, more deliberate, more regulated (we had to get city approvals, Liquor Control Board approvals, and approvals from the Washington State Department of Agriculture), and in the end, I believe we\\'ll have a strong sustainable legalized marijuana system,\" he told XXX. He says green beverages are an amazing, untapped new market, and he\\'s happy to be able to \"create a product that allows others to enjoy their new freedoms.\" It\\'s an opportunity to make an amazing, unique, unusual, and delicious product while also making history, Stites said.

       "             'Hemp seeds have long been a staple in health-food stores, being prized for decades for their nutritional benefits theyre a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, a complete protein source, and a rich source of essential minerals, including magnesium, phosphorus, iron and zinc. In the past few years, hemp seeds have gained popularity and have started moving into mainstream markets. These days, you can even find them at Trader Joes. People sprinkle them on their salads, blend them into their smoothies, bake them into granolas and even turn them into hemp milk. But theres something many people just cant get over: hemps link to marijuana . As we sprinkle the seeds on top of our salads, we cant help but wonder: whats the deal with hemp seeds and THC? What are hemp seeds, actually? Hemp seeds are cultivated from the hemp plant, which is grown predominantly for its seeds and fibers. Heres where the confusion comes from: The hemp plant looks a bit like the marijuana plant and it actually come from the same plant species , Cannabis Sativa L, but there are major differences between the two. For one, the marijuana plant is stalkier, while the hemp plant is taller and thinner. But more importantly, the hemp plant contains low levels ( less than 0.3 percent ) of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of Cannabis Sativa. Marijuana can contain anywhere from 5 to 30 percent. The seeds of the hemp plant are housed in small, brown hulls that are removed before we get our hands on them. The white seeds we buy at the store are the inner seeds, sometimes called the heart, and theyre soft enough to eat and cook. Will hemp seeds get you high? The short answer is no . As mentioned above, hemp seeds are not cultivated from the marijuana plant, but from the hemp plant, which contains minute amounts of THC. According to Jolene Formene, staff attorney at Drug Policy Alliance , Hemp seeds are non-psychoactive, meaning that consumers cannot get high by eating them. In other words, its impossible to get high from them. They also wont cause you to fail a drug test. We know that other foods like poppy seeds, which contain trace amounts of opiates , can make you fail a drug test. Certain places actually ask that you dont eat poppy seed bagels or muffins before testing. But hemp seeds wont cause the same confusion. A study found that eating hemp seeds had little effect on a persons THC levels and never enough to exceed the levels looked for in federal drug testing programs. So, now that you know you can pass a drug test and eat hemp seeds, here are a few recipes you should try.': '301120005447.txt',\n",

Chief among its aims is to accurately define marijuana as anything that includes marijuana, according to a recent news story from the Arizona Daily Star.\\nWhile the article called out the colleges backing for Amendment 1, Californias constitution has both a vague ban on smoking recreationally and a constitutional guarantee of legal marijuana, as well as a challenge to Proposition 64, which allowed for some of the biggest single-marijuana businesses in the country.\\nThe lawsuit arguing against Amendment 3 alleges that Amendment One harms recreational marijuana use and reduces the quality of legitimate cannabis production. If Amendment 3 passed, Amendment 3 would allow no smoking and students would still be forced to cover marijuana exposure.\\nThe University of California and other universities have been one of the few bastions of voter support for a legalization issuethough some others have downplayed the issue, and critics have suggested that Amendment 3 is still too close to be wrapped up in the haggard antics of non-marijuana businesses like Live Nation.\\nThe editorial in the February 2013 issue of the California Institute of Medicine, published to coincide with a college board vote on Amendment 3, said that Amendment 3 would not safeguard medical marijuana at all. Prop. 64s limitations would not shield legal pot sellers from future federal regulation, the editorial said.

       "             \"The crowds of happy people lighting joints under Seattles Space Needle early Thursday morning with nary a police officer in sight bespoke the new reality: Marijuana is legal under Washington state law. Hundreds gathered at Seattle Center for a New Years Eve-style countdown to 12 a.m., when the legalization measure passed by voters last month took effect. When the clock struck, they cheered and sparked up in unison. A few dozen people gathered on a sidewalk outside the north Seattle headquarters of the annual Hempfest celebration and did the same, offering joints to reporters and blowing smoke into television news cameras. Washington and Colorado became the first states to vote to decriminalize and regulate the possession of an ounce or less of marijuana by adults over 21. Both measures call for setting up state licensing schemes for pot growers, processors and retail stores. Colorados law is set to take effect by Jan. 5. Technically, Washingtons new marijuana law still forbids smoking pot in public, which remains punishable by a fine, like drinking in public. But pot fans wanted a party, and Seattle police werent about to write them any tickets. In another sweeping change for Washington, Gov. Chris Gregoire on Wednesday signed into law a measure that legalizes same-sex marriage. The state joins several others that allow gay and lesbian couples to wed. The mood was festive in Seattle as dozens of gay and lesbian couples got in line to pick up marriage licenses at the King County auditors office early Thursday. King County and Thurston County announced they would open their auditors offices shortly after midnight Wednesday to accommodate those who wanted to be among the first to get their licenses. Kelly Middleton and her partner Amanda Dollente got in line at 4 p.m. Wednesday. Hours later, as the line grew, volunteers distributed roses and a group of men and women serenaded the waiting line to the tune of Going to the Chapel. Because the state has a three-day waiting period, the earliest that weddings can take place is Sunday. In dealing with marijuana, the Seattle Police Department told its 1,300 officers on Wednesday, just before legalization took hold, that until further notice they shall not issue citations for public marijuana use. Officers will be advising people not to smoke in public, police spokesman Jonah Spangenthal-Lee wrote on the SPD Blotter. The police department believes that, under state law, you may responsibly get baked, order some pizzas and enjoy a `Lord of the Rings marathon in the privacy of your own home, if you want to. He offered a catchy new directive referring to the film The Big Lebowski, popular with many marijuana fans: The Dude abides, and says `take it inside!' Washingtons new law decriminalizes possession of up to an ounce for those over 21, but for now selling marijuana remains illegal. I-502 gives the state a year to come up with a system of state-licensed growers, processors and retail stores, with the marijuana taxed 25 percent at each stage. Analysts have estimated that a legal pot market could bring Washington hundreds of millions of dollars a year in new tax revenue for schools, health care and basic government functions. But marijuana remains illegal under federal law. That means federal agents can still arrest people for it, and its banned from federal properties, including military bases and national parks. The Justice Department has not said whether it will sue to try to block the regulatory schemes in Washington and Colorado from taking effect. The legal question is whether the establishment of a regulated marijuana market would frustrate the purpose of the federal pot prohibition, and many constitutional law scholars say it very likely would. That leaves the political question of whether the administration wants to try to block the regulatory system, even though it would remain legal to possess up to an ounce of marijuana. Alison Holcomb is the drug policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington and served as the campaign manager for New Approach Washington, which led the legalization drive. She said the voters clearly showed theyre done with marijuana prohibition.\": '301120105811.txt',\n",

Stone, whose new film Savages opens Friday, is currently extolling the wonders of weed for willing press outlets. The topic keeps coming up because Savages deals with a fictional drug war saga starring Benicio del Toro, Salma Hayek, Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Johnson. But Stone also has a serious message to share. Illegal marijuana laws have a detrimental effect on society. Just how detrimental? Take it away, Oliver. Still, the film offers a fictional portrait of violence among a Mexican drug cartel and California pot growers that makes legalizing marijuana seem like a sane option. That would be my personal solution, but as a politician, I would fight for decriminalization first, because that is the immediate by-product of this mess that we got ourselves into. Its very hard to pull out of a $40 billion-a-year industry, which is the prison industry. Its probably more than $40 billion. But they will fight you tooth and nail to keep these prisons as big as they are, Stone said. Its worse than slavery, per capita. In the black community, it is a form of slavery, this drug war, because it imprisons a huge portion of people, destroys their lives, coarsens our culture. And why? Marijuana is much less harmful than tobacco and prescription drugs in many cases and certainly alcohol. This puritanical strain got started with Nixon. It was a political issue for him, and its gotten worse. Its like the Pentagon. You cant stop it. But to those who say Stone is a consistently anti-American voice, think again. Stone thinks U.S.-based pot growers are the best in the world.

But 91 percent of respondents favor legalization if government action involved regulating marijuana.\\nOur experience shows that health-related and economic burdens are significant issues that outweigh any benefits for doctors or patients, said Quinnipiac University Executive Director Rebecca Roth in a statement. Taking these lessons into account, it is the best possible decision for patients and doctors.\\nProfessor of Clinical Pharmacology Dr. Michael Tanke, a professor of psychiatry at Iowa State University, said he doubts the primary issue will be whether legalization will make medical marijuana safe.\\nThey may just be an inconvenience in the application of marijuana to surgery and vision, Tanke said, adding that medical marijuana has an important advantage over recreational weed in terms of being an undesirable drug.\\nThe more difficult problem is whether medical marijuana has a real clinical benefit in alleviating pain and treating anxiety or how it affects patients. According to one bill released in November 2012, federal funds would be used for research into medical marijuana.\\nDavid Adams, director of the Center for Medical Cannabis Research, said researchers do not use pot as a substitute for marijuana to treat pain or anxiety.\\nThis is legal, and the FDA tends to over regulate this, he said. Their drug testing for people up and down the country doesnt identify the drug. They didnt. But here they are approving it. There are indications of over-prescribing.\\n': '301120105806.txt',\n",

And really thats the problem. A 2013 study prepared for the U.K. agency that commissioned the paper  Legacy of Lifelong Freedom  says that the code of discernment and justification behind the violation of marriage laws is so simple that its reasonable to choose the position between the arguments made by many people and the positions of advocates on the other side.\\nKeep in mind the decades of anti-homosexual legislation the country has been pursuing and the entire world has been shocked by how quickly the government took on this topic and began to put a strain on relationships, especially in the U.K. in particular. There is now a sizeable restriction for the taking of gay men in some areas, a ban on a certain amount of consensual gay sex in family affairs, a commission in Europe and a bill in the European Parliament of moving same-sex marriage by legislation. The UK has gained a reputation for being more open about their treatment of gay and lesbian people. This helps in respect to the fact that more people in the UK are on discrimination cover, not homosexuals themselves. In order to cover up such misconduct by authorities the legal justification will have to be delivered as yet another reason that they will be doing so.\\nRead our previous columns about this work:\\nHow to follow the definition:\\nHow to circumvent the delayed point, like in the U.S., whereby it is necessary to get through an administrative agency for doing the crossing. This policy is designed to circumvent the customary protocol of using the states laws as a guide and to straighten out the enforcement plans. The smaller the discretion of the state, the faster the violation will come out. It is a lawful state law. And it is often seen as a barrier to enforcement. The mantra of these state statutes is stay on. This is common sense and all too common sense. At least 10 times in the U.K. for example, one minister had a ban on kissing against parliament in order to help support financial support for gay couples.\\nThe most likely security balance: would there be armed guards for the invasion of the frontier or would it be in England or Wales where Christians are a minority? If there were those armed guards there could be no indigenous killing or rapes.

It is as if you are the only one who has to endure such a crisis.\\nYour intuition is critical: If the person says something, he needs to be reminded that the person is already engaged in criminal activity  like a prison, not a doctor. This is a reason to keep reminding yourself.\\nNoise: If you are listening, its important to keep asking yourself how many people we listen to when we look into what is going on.

Here's a sampling of quotes from them\\nA guy who thinks he can only pick up something that doesn't violate his drug policy could be considered a federal criminal. That's the prevailing thinking from many in the political right. There are people in this court thinking (that should apply to myself, too) that the gentry (control-grabbing surly) represents a disordered state of affairs. There are those arguing that if Scalia were to rule this way it would very quickly become clear to me that the federal government would restrict access to such things as mass incarceration and public school curriculum. But he already has. There would be a lot of states and some really, really strong objections to his ruling. But any number of states would be very likely to side with the man, rather than overturn his ruling.\\nThere are other conservatives arguing that if there is a widespread demand for marijuana in the United States this would give our government too much power and reach too far ahead of state drug policies. I don't mean to deny someone's right to do whatever they please, but it would be very much within the bounds of their meaning and needs. Thus this can't come up as a certainty. It is a quasi-question for everyone to consider, but the only reason I don't believe anyone has a legal right to possession of unadulterated marijuana is that they are going to be making a decision that's impervious to their laws.\\nSome individuals in this court's thinking have expressed intense opposition to the federal enforcement of marijuana laws. Remarks from jurists such as Justices Samuel Alito and Sandra Day O'Connor highlight the damage that the federal prosecutions and government-sponsored mass incarceration of people seeking marijuana possession points to. The question is whether we have the power to arrest, search and ultimately imprison these individuals as marijuana traffickers. They are not just repeating the same choice made by President Obama the other day. The federal state marijuana laws have already targeted thousands of individuals and businesses. It is a big issue for the courts and an area of law that isn't likely to change anytime soon.\\nThe financial rationale that this comes down to is not likely to change. For those of you who track the transaction between the purchase of a computerized screwdriver and the purposes of making it, you might be forgiven for thinking that it's just the virtual lender trying to get you to buy the printer right now. It's just not the case. There is a market in that kind of stuff. The financial and legal benefits of marijuana remain both strong arguments.

       "             \"So reading the first quarter of so of Scalia's piece and the blog, it seems their (the majority's) main rationale hinges on that they believe that California's marijuana market (in this case) interferes with federal regulations of interstate commerce (illegal drug trade). The question to me is whether this interference is really substantial enough to warrant such a potential expansion of powers of the Commerce Clause. I think the reality is that creating a legal medical marijuana market *does* have an impact on the marijuana supply in other states as well. It creates a legal market for a previously illegal good within California. However, this good is easily transferable to out of state (it's not like marijuana expires; and if a medical marijuana license was as easy to obtain as it is today, then the restrictions wouldn't prevent out of staters from getting a license). As such, to me it seems understandable at face value that SCOTUS would be concerned about an over extension of a state's ability to impact out of state markets through such a legalization. Furthermore, since the time of the ruling, what qualifies as interstate commerce has only become more complicated with the advances in technology which have taken place which make it even easier to order goods from out of state. Does the ruling open a potential pandora's box of extending federal government power over the commerce clause? The way that the majority opinions seem to state it, it doesn't necessarily. They leave it rather vague, and seem to only validate such a ruling for a case dealing with specific markets such as illegal substances.\": '051020131146.txt',\n",
       "             'Hmm, the sugar argument I find pretty persuasive. While its tempting to say we can just ban sugar, or go back to my position on cigarettes/ alcohol, I suppose the only decent justification for the continuing legality of sugar is its relative proximity to being neccesary or unharmed up in our society. It could be possible (though heavily unlikely) that cheap, sugary foods are the only way some impoverished Alaskan people survive. I dont think such a fringe case is easily attributable to recreational marijuana. It could be fairly argued that the main issue regarding sugar is the fast food industry, but even if such an argument could be made, it would be pretty diluted at best. Your point for #4, on the other hand, I feel is contradictory with the sugar argument. If marijuana were to be legalized, you say, the average quality of marijuana sold would go up. But clearly, fast food companies are not selling high quality foods that include sugar. Similarly, the explosion in demand for marijuana after its legalization would likely cause a few shifty producers to make marijuana as cheap as possible. This kind of leads into #5, where a sudden increase in opportunity leads to shady practices. Im not defending McDs or coke as good companies, just that two wrongs dont make a right, and limiting the amount of invasive corporation is probably a good thing. Im convinced at least that it wouldnt be that bad, or at least not as bad as sugar is already, but Im not 100 percent on the justification that we do bad things already, so why not do more, not as bad things?': '051020131150.txt',\n",

(The UK\\'s version of euthanasia has reported that 34% of its patients as a group still would be entitled to terminally ill diagnoses and euthanasia, regardless of whether or not they choose to live.) Other research shows cannabis products produced as part of industry in Canada include a range of THC-based, THC-based, THC-based, or CBD products. Using CBD, it is found in marijuana plants that are naturally a plant, infused with a CBD compound. Cannabis is a completely different animal but produces full CBD, and it was human brain\\'s potential to diagnose and treat pain that allowed research into CBD products to be done. After making some serious, detailed hay in this road taking pursuit, cannabis is now being sold by some companies that are on the cutting edge of neuroscience-based clinical studies. In addition to cannabis and the opioid issue and ecstasy, some of the most popular products include a range of medicines that aim to make people more resilient to dealing with pain and far more sophisticated solutions that actually help with issues as complicated as illness and mental illness.

When she approached the states marijuana industry, she was confronted with a lecture from a manager of a chain of dispensaries who held no official background checks for her.\\nGarvey and her team used Pulse Strategy, a research project based at the University of Texas at Austin, to examine the hidden risks for weed as it has been legalized in New Mexico, Wisconsin, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Nevada, and Minnesota.\\nSo when she first came across one dispensary, she thought about buying medicine  cannabis-infused medicine that supposedly only harms the heart and soul  but soon learned that it is an essential ingredient of medical marijuana. While pills and cannabis vitamins are claimed to treat complex conditions like heart and nervous system diseases, a dispensary in the West, in Utah, has marijuana that treats different ailments, including chronic pain, diabetes, and cancer.\\nBefore further checking the literature, Garvey found two surveys in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism. Both tests turned positive, concluding that cannabis-based medicines are the least common pain medicine in the United States.\\nGarvey and her team focused on one dispensary in Columbus, Ohio, as well as one that was closed for more than a year following drug addiction allegations. She also looked at another dispensary in Rochester, New York, that opened July 1 and contracted with Salient Medical to provide cannabis for a normal patient. Those doctors and others at the threshold of approval to prescribe cannabis vaporizers like cannabidiol or air salts, and she found a 5 percent clearance rate.\\nOnce again, the technology and experience of dispensaries let Garvey determine why it is that much more common than prescribed medicine in people. That leaves an important question unanswered.\\nAre these people the primary beneficiaries of legalized marijuana? Garvey asks. We began to investigate the medical benefits of our work.\\nThe questions follow this discovery of a secret combination of factors that allows marijuana to be used to treat similar conditions that people typically do not know about.\\nWake up, you open the lid, Garvey says. Thats all that you have.\\nResearchers then quickly expand the predictive value of cannabis to the apps that allow those services to be used at any given time. They ask a third-party lender to check their card history to see if patients having an opioid prescription are carrying a marijuana strain or combination of marijuana (no amount of pills, infused oils, and infusion each time?), and suggest all of those solutions in addition to the newest medical cannabis products.\\nIts the lowest possible dose, Garvey says. Its good.\\nGarvey hopes others can learn about the efficacy of cannabinoid medicine at smaller companies so that patients can come into the office and experience a better kind of medicine.\\nThis is a stage of experimentation, she says.

As the worldwide market shifts to pot, smoking legal, not easier marijuana, may be the only way to play!\\nGroups like the Marijuana Policy Project [MPA] and Greenleaf had a heated debate in Congress over the future of pot in 2011. As the policy fell apart, the Marijuana Policy Project lost their position as one of the political hotbeds of one of Europes largest cities, according to the New York Times. After Congress passed a bill to allow pot cultivation in Ireland, critics contended that it would only increase laws against malpractice that would lead to liability for medical marijuana users.\\nThe thing is, most states have implemented a law to allow federal law enforcement to more broadly evaluate whether pot is legal in both states or depending on whichever legal distillery you choose. The MPA tells us they will try to give more leeway to upstate governors before making legal moves. The legislation would essentially make it harder for marijuana to be passed, but it would come with a condition: this helps states to secure legal, non-marijuana trading permits with their feds.\\nBut legalizing cannabis might not get the support that it deserves in Congress.\\nThe best chance to apply for business cards with a Massachusetts license is to get one from an enforcement agency that states licenses and regulates pot and American licensing of pot.\\nIf the request is denied, US agencies could get the opportunity to replace the agencys existing license system for marijuana with a new one. This new system would allow for more customization for marijuana plants, significantly increasing the likelihood that the dealer is expanding into customers trade places.\\nIf this approach works and all cannabis is legal, some states could also crack down on other kind of marijuana product sales.

       "             'There are a lot of superlative claims about hemp oil: most unsaturated oil, best essential fatty acids (EFA) ratio and combination, highest amino acid variety, only plant source of vitamin D. Can one oil be all that? In short, yes. Before we go further, let me address that unspoken question, \"Will hemp oil make me high?\" No, it won\\'t. Hemp oil is pressed from the seed of the hemp plant, and this seed does not contain THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, which is the psychoactive component of marijuana. However, because of this concern, many hemp oil suppliers provide transparent certifications to assure buyers of the lack of THC content in their products. Test Pledge is one such resource, wherein \"producers and processors of hemp oil and hemp nut must commission THC tests on each and every lot of hemp nut and oil, performed by a properly accredited laboratory according to the official Health Canada protocol.\" In their assessment of hemp cosmetics on workplace drug testing, Petra Pless, DEnv, and Gero Leson, D Env, state, \"In case of the highly unlikely full-body application of pure hemp oil with a 10 ppm THC content on partially compromised skin THC uptake could conceivably be raised to 11 g/day. Even this higher rate is only a fraction of the 450 g/day of oral THC intake, found not to result in a positive screening test for marijuana .\" Don\\'t judge hemp because it may have a kooky cousin. That\\'s hardly fair. Who doesn\\'t have an offbeat family member or two? Why Hemp Hemp oil contains unsurpassed essential fatty acids (EFAs). As we are increasingly learning, there are good fats and there are bad fats. What makes a good fat good has much to do with these EFAs, specifically omega-3 and omega-6, which are present in hemp oil in the perfect ratio of 1:3. Plus, hemp oil contains the anti-inflammatory gamma linoleic acid (GLA) as well as omega-9. Its fatty acid profile is better than fish oil\\'s, better than flaxseed oil\\'s--it is the best. Among many benefits, these EFAs provide for more elastic skin and shiny, stronger hair. Hemp oil contains a power-packed punch of additional nutrients , including calcium, potassium, magnesium, copper, vitamin A, vitamin B1 (thiamin), vitamin B3 (niacin), vitamin B5, vitamin B9 (folate), and vitamin D (of which it is the only plant source), along with a useful dose of the antioxidant vitamin E (tocopherols) as well as all 10 amino acids for protein building. Add to that list chlorophyll (that\\'s why it\\'s green), phytosterols, phospholipids, magnesium, sulfur, potassium, phosphorus, and a bit of iron and zinc. Hemp oil is extremely non-comodogenic. In other words, it doesn\\'t clog pores. And because its lipids mirror the lipids that our skin produces naturally, it works in sync with our body to soothe and cleanse. Healthy skin produces linoleic acid. If, for whatever reason, the skin can\\'t produce linoleic acid, it alternatively produces oleic acid, a thick and sticky pore blocker. Hemp oil contains the good linoleic acid. Hemp oil is also a natural humectant, which means it draws moisture into the skin. Instead of sitting on top of the skin the way less-effective oils do, it\\'s able to penetrate the skin, moisturizing between cells and strengthening the cell matrix. It can get to hair roots, as well, strengthening the scalp and reducing dry flaking or dandruff. It evens out skin tone and reduces blotchiness. How to Use It Hemp oil is inexpensive--especially when you think of all the products it replaces: acne treatments, makeup to cover problem areas, moisturizers, and makeup removers, for instance. Here are just a few ways you can use this effective oil in your daily skin and hair care routines. Alleviate dry skin. Rub the oil directly onto dry, cracked skin. For a deep conditioning treatment for hands and feet, massage in the oil then wear socks or gloves overnight to let it work its magic. Strengthen nails and heal cuticles. Massage a small amount of hemp oil directly into nails and cuticles--great for both fingernails and toenails. Remove makeup. Oil follows the \"like dissolves like\" rule, which means that hemp oil will dissolve the oils and waxes in makeup, especially in stubborn eye makeup. Gently rub a small amount of oil into the makeup and wipe with a cotton ball or a soft tissue. Mask overnight . Massage hemp oil into cleansed facial skin before bedtime. Steam facial skin. Massage a tablespoon of oil into the skin on your dry, clean face, massaging for several minutes. Then lay a hot (not scalding) damp washcloth over your face and let it sit until it cools. Wipe with the washcloth. Repeat with another hot washcloth until all the oil is wiped off. Washing your face afterwards is optional. Condition hair. Before shampooing, massage a tablespoon or so of hemp oil into your scalp and let it sit for about 10 minutes. Afterwards, shampoo as normal. You might find you don\\'t need conditioner. Reduce acne. This may sound crazy, but this oil actually reduces acne. Massage hemp oil into problem areas and work it in gently for several minutes. The oil will actually draw out sebum plugs that cause whiteheads, blackheads, and even cysts. Do this daily during breakouts. Relieve eczema . A 2005 study found that 2 tablespoons of dietary hemp seed oil consumed daily may help relieve the effects of atopic dermatitis, or eczema. Support overall health. Eat it. You can eat it straight and enjoy its nutty flavor or you can put it in salad dressings, as a butter replacement on toast, rice, potatoes, vegetables...it\\'s delicious! Keep in mind that pure hemp seed oil cannot be used for high-heat cooking. It has a low smoke point and will totally break down even at a moderate heat, at which point all nutritional benefits are lost. Just remember, pure hemp seed oil goes rancid easily. It needs to be kept in the fridge. However, you can look for it as a shelf-stable ingredient in other personal care products.': '170321174857.txt',\n",
       "             'Two just-published studies assessing adults\\' risk of cancer have reported wildly divergent, and fairly extraordinary, outcomes. One study you may have read about. The other has been ignored entirely by the mainstream media. But no doubt the results of both will surprise you. First, the study you may have heard of. Writing August 3 in the journal Cancer Epidemiology , investigators at McGill University in Montreal reported that moderate alcohol consumption -- defined as six drinks or fewer per week -- by adults is positively associated with an elevated risk of various cancers, including stomach cancer, rectal cancer, and bladder cancer. And now for the study you haven\\'t heard of. Writing in the August issue of the journal Cancer Prevention Research , investigators from Rhode Island\\'s Brown University, along with researchers at Boston University, Louisiana State University, and the University of Minnesota reported that lifetime marijuana use is associated with a \"significantly reduced risk\" of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Authors reported, \"after adjusting for potential confounders (including smoking and alcohol drinking), 10 to 20 years of marijuana use was associated with a significantly reduced risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNDCC).\" Perhaps even more notably, subjects who smoked marijuana and consumed alcohol and tobacco (two known high risk factors for head and neck cancers) also experienced a reduced risk of cancer, the study found. \" Our study suggests that moderate marijuana use is associated with reduced risk of HNSCC ,\" investigators concluded. \"This association was consistent across different measures of marijuana use (marijuana use status, duration, and frequency of use)....Further, we observed that marijuana use modified the interaction between alcohol and cigarette smoking, resulting in a decreased HNSCC risk among moderate smokers and light drinkers, and attenuated risk among the heaviest smokers and drinkers.\" This isn\\'t the first time that U.S. investigators have documented an inverse association between pot use and cancer. A separate 2006 population case-control study, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and conducted by the University of California at Los Angeles, also reported that lifetime use of cannabis was not positively associated with cancers of the lung or aerodigestive tract, and further noted that certain moderate users of the drug experienced a reduced cancer risk compared to non-using controls. Predictably, the federal government\\'s goal when green-lighting the UCLA study was to conclusively establish just the opposite result, as explained recently by its lead researcher Dr. Donald Tashkin. In an interview with the McClatchy newspaper chain in June, Dr. Tashkin admitted that he expected his study would find that pot was associated with \"increased health effects.\" Instead, he summarized, \"What we found instead was no association (between marijuana smoking and cancer) and even a suggestion of some protective effect.\" Tashkin added, \"[A]t this point, I\\'d be in favor of (marijuana) legalization. I wouldn\\'t encourage anybody to smoke any substances. But I don\\'t think it should be stigmatized as an illegal substance. Tobacco smoking causes far more harm. And in terms of an intoxicant, alcohol causes far more harm (than marijuana).\" Despite these findings, which to date inexplicably remain under-reported by the mainstream press, many so-called experts persist with claims that marijuana smoking is causally linked to cancer. In fact, in June the California Environmental Protection Agency with great fanfare added marijuana smoke to its list of chemicals that possess potential carcinogenic properties and/or are associated with reproductive toxicity. You know what other commonly indulged in substance also appears on this list? That would be alcohol. Of course that conclusion, much like the reports of marijuana\\'s anti-cancer prowess, apparently went up in smoke.': '050121173259.txt',\n",
       "             'Scientists in Israel are exploring another medical use for marijuana: Their research indicates that a compound in the plant helps heal bone fractures. The new study , published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research , found that broken bones healed faster and stronger when the patient received the non-psychoactive compound cannabidiol, or CBD. \"We found that CBD alone makes bones stronger during healing, enhancing the maturation of the collagenous matrix, which provides the basis for new mineralization of bone tissue,\" said Dr. Yankel Gabet, one of the lead researchers, in a statement. \"After being treated with CBD, the healed bone will be harder to break in the future.\" Researchers administered CBD to a group of rats with mid-femoral fractures. After just eight weeks, they saw marked improvement in the broken bones. They injected another group of rats with a mixture of CBD and THC, marijuana\\'s psychoactive ingredient. Comparing the results, they concluded that CBD alone was an effective treatment. Researchers explained that humans have a naturally occurring endocannabinoid system, which regulates a number of physiological processes as well as the skeleton. The human brain and body are thus prepped to be responsive to cannabinoids, even those from an outside source like marijuana. Gabet of the Bone Research Laboratory at Tel Aviv University and the late professor Itai Bab of the Bone Laboratory at Hebrew University led the research. A number of studies in recent years have demonstrated the medical potential of marijuana. Purified forms of cannabis have been tied to better blood sugar control and may help slow the spread of HIV . A growing body of research suggests CBD may also be effective in reducing inflammation brought on by multiple sclerosis , stopping metastasis in many kinds of aggressive cancer , killing cancerous cells in people with leukemia and serving as an alternative antipsychotic treatment . \"The clinical potential of cannabinoid-related compounds is simply undeniable at this point,\" Gabet said. Seventeen U.S. states have legalized CBD for limited medical use or research, and 23 other states have more broadly legalized marijuana for medical purposes. Still, the federal government continues to ban the plant, classifying it as one of the \"most dangerous\" drugs with \" no currently accepted medical use .\"': '050121173311.txt',\n",

(i.e., many of them are people with a very low opinion of marijuana. Doctors estimate they are roughly 6 percent of the 1.5 million adults polled by the CDC.)\\nBut the survey does show a stigmas surrounding legalization that remain at-risk, which may explain the apparent contradictory expectations. The actual number is less important  60 percent of doctors favored legalization, versus 75 percent who opposed legalization in 2012. Nearly all doctors (79 percent) said the decision would result in higher costs. Fifty-one percent of doctors oppose it.\\nNew York Daily News columnist Michael Caputo reminds readers that despite increasing American cannabis use, the medical value of those who oppose legalization is actually lower, and that some doctors are now a bit skeptical of the trend.\\nAs the American Medical Association claims, California, Arizona, and Florida have enacted laws that allow adults to legally possess up to 1 ounce of medical marijuana. This came just one day after The New York Times reported that six Canadian provinces and territories have legally legalized the drug since March 14, prompting at least one Globe editorial from advocate Susan McCartin:\\nBut not all Western nations, including Canada, remain opposed to pot. That could have resulted in different opinion platforms during the relatively quiet period in which that countrys legalization takes place.\\nI encourage readers to keep in mind that no one knows more about a particular policy stance than Dr. Charles MacLeod, of the University of Georgia in Atlanta.\\nIn 2013, 57 percent of the adult U.S. population believed marijuana should be allowed for medical use, despite major research showing that it does far more harm than good.\\nOpinion goes in the opposite direction. Almost a third of all Americans say that they would support legalization if it led to better outcomes for people who use marijuana. More than half of respondents say marijuana will not cause problems in the near future. More than 50 percent said their lives will be better if marijuana prohibition was ended.\\nAccording to a 2009 study by researchers at University of Pennsylvania, doctor-assisted suicide has long been a controversial topic, but there is no evidence that patients who abuse end-of-life-care drugs are safer than those who dont. Several scientific studies have been done that show that physicians use a considerable proportion of their patients opioid prescriptions.\\nParents and consumers have varying views of the scope of the dangers of medical marijuana. However, many of them agree that it shouldnt be used for mental illness, which can lead to serious harm.\\nAs in Canada, as law in the state is often contradictory to one another, there is no public consensus on the issue. While a state lawmaker proposed local legislation to legalize the use of medical marijuana, several states  all five in the top three  have already legalized marijuana.\\nAmong the findings:\\n State legislators and health organizations all support legalizing marijuana.\\n According to the CDC, 70 percent of Americans believe that marijuana should be permitted as a substance that advances happiness, health, and physical health.\\nMedical marijuana uses have been decriminalized in 14 states across the U.S. (but not all).\\nSome of the results are surprising, given that research has consistently shown that the use of marijuana is a health hazard, though medical marijuana use is not a public health issue.

Its almost a pill.\\nWhich brings me to my favorite blog entry of 2009, The Death of Doctors, Nourishing Physiology and Medicine that will serve as an excellent lesson on how to treat cancer without catastrophizing doctors. As writer and physician Dr. Harlan Koritzka wrote in his landmark book on smoking:\\nWhen an infected person smokes a cigarette, it is either because they are or were smokers  or because they worked under physicians, like those practicing medicine in the United States.\\nFinally, the proponent of smoking demonstrates his basic cold-calling and vaporizing skills by showing up in the kitchen in an envelope and ordering boxes and paper envelopes that he has made for himself. Amazingly, these boxes look like the handlong items from the suburban store.\\nYears later, like in his book, Better to Leave a Medicine Inside Your Own Comfort Zone, Igor Volozhin gives the example of my subjects heroic attempts to treat an unexpected case of cancer from a guy who sent me a check for over $100,000.

The oil itself can add value for areas of your body that are damaged and maladies like hypercompatibility, low testosterone, ageing, and phsyopia. Hemp oil isnt exactly cruelty free, but it also has a great range of chemicals and is available for a host of other uses. For starters, your skin can easily go from tired and burned from dehydrated food to fresh and unnatural, so make sure you get one now. Also, if youre developing pet hair or scruffy scalp, natural hair oil is a much healthier alternative to alternative oils. Hemp oil does a good job of keeping hair separate from the skin, so it does not have to be combed or sprayed. Just remember, you can use the oils if you just want to stay hydrated or if youre looking to add new energy to your body.\\nDairy oils are another area of interest for algae, some of which also have a naturally occurring substance. Theres also some natural algae extracts found in coffee and tea that can help decrease blood pressure and pain. Tucked into the recipe in the Health section is a vegan version called scololans. You can use the oil in place of the dairy product, but it doesnt have to be applied to the skin in order to stop the oil from sticking to skin. No larger restriction is required, though, as there are lotions for your body, health care products and cleansing products available.\\nFinally, hemp oil is less expensive than other oils in the natural oil category, so take your oil habit with you through the rest of your life to clean it up. Hemp oil can be a great solution for skin issues like psoriasis and acne. You also have to think before you use or operate the oil. If you happen to be concerned about the oil, consider using an extension cord or compression tube that could be used to push it into the right place. Keep in mind, not all hemp oil is found in the pureest of forms. So, be sure to compare an oil that is much more complex for your skin type to one that is of lesser impact and will have a longer shelf life.\\nYou can find out more about hemp oil in the Healthy Living section of the Healthy Living section on XXX\\n': '050121173314.txt',\n",

       "             'Cannabis is having a skincare moment. Beauty and wellness products containing cannabidiol (CBD), and possibly tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), are becoming increasingly popular . CBD, along with THC, are the two most common cannabinoids found in cannabis (a.k.a. marijuana), but they have different effects. CBD is touted as having therapeutic and stress-relieving benefits , while THC is responsible for the high associated with marijuana use. Additionally, CBD is legal in many states , while THC is not. You can find cannabis products for a relaxing bath, for soothing sore muscles and for healing chapped lips. Theyve even a found fan in Olivia Wilde, who raved about a topical CBD lotion by Lord Jones in a 2017 New York Times profile . And celebrity stylist Karla Welch has said she tells her clients (like Wilde, Katy Perry and Sarah Paulson) to use it on their feet for red carpet events. Dr. Samer Jaber of Washington Square Dermatology told XXX that while the enthusiasm for cannabinoids in skincare is definitely growing, the science behind cannabis and cannabinoids for skin health is still sparse. A lot of the research focuses on the cannabinoids usefulness in relieving itchiness associated with dry skin and eczema . Cannabinoids also have some anti-inflammatory effects, as well as potential anti-tumor effects , Jaber said, though he added that much more research remains to be done. Unfortunately, most of the studies on the cannabinoids have been done in the laboratory only and there are very few studies on people, Jaber said. So additional well-controlled, clinical studies need to be done to see how effective these ingredients actually are in real life. Another issue with cannabinoids in skincare products is that its difficult to know exactly what youre getting, Jaber said. Since it is not regulated its difficult to know what you are actually putting on your body, he said. Dr. Angela Lamb , director of the Westside Mount Sinai Dermatology Faculty Practice in New York, echoed Jaber, telling XXX, We just do not have any strong research to support beneficial effects on the skin. My aim is to be research-focused in health care. Anyone can make claims, but I want to see what studies have shown, and as it relates to cannabis, there is just not a lot of support yet. It may come in several years, but until then, I think a lot of it is hype, she added. I do not think it is harmful, I am just not sure it helps.

Doctors at the medical marijuana clinic in Denver have reported a 10% drop in the number of new patients due to medical marijuana testing, with clinical marijuana patients having fewer than 1,500 waiting for their marijuana test.\\nEven with the decriminalization of recreational marijuana users, Colorado does not have the greatest number of medical marijuana patients. Researchers at Vanderbilt University published a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association last summer that found a vast majority of marijuana-legalized patients do not respond well to marijuana testing, which according to previous studies is usually diagnosed around 1-2 years after the patients first appearance with a doctor. Furthermore, as medical marijuana is a less-common medical option, there is an increased risk of acquiring high levels of the drug.\\nTheres been a change in medical marijuana usage within the past year, but we know its not widespread, Wayne Ehrlich, MD, G.E.T., co-founder of Mint Prat Patient Day, told NBC4 Denver. This represents the most uncertainty as to whether or not were going to see an increase.\\nSo far, only two Colorado medical marijuana dispensaries are open, said Ehrlich. In October, the doctor-controlled liquid store Upstate New York Fresh Gluten provided Dr. Holiday, who has also worked with Gresham-Seeds in Colorado, to perform live lab tests using multiple marijuana-infused liquid capsules containing lignan. The tests showed that the capsules were high in the antioxidant protein glycolic acid (a color on marijuana used to find local, lower risk of cancer), which was common and appropriate in first-ever lab tests.\\nLongtime law enforcement officers showed up at Upstate New York Fresh Gluten offered urine samples to help guide parents through the rules, Ehrlich said. They also approved marijuana-based counseling that helped doctors deal with the issue of marijuana through their legal team. The treatment was approved by a bill passed by Colorado legislators, which no longer applies to medical marijuana patients.\\nI dont think any of the doctors are coming in now, Ehrlich said. So I dont think the law enforcement is going to be practicing their religion here in Colorado.\\nEven as the recreational marijuana sales boom continues to ebb, some people in the medical marijuana community are already starting to question the validity of their use.\\nHolly Prunkett-Sabara has discussed the growing uncertainty with her husband, who is legally under 18.

This means that it is being used to treat those who are becoming dependent on the drug for even longer and have inconsistent and sometimes ill-defined benefits. The task is now pretty much impossible for anyone, and a clear decision about making cannabis a practice is being made without much consideration for medical patients.\\nIf cannabis and medical marijuana companies determine that they need to put a limit on how much it can be grown, and how much it is expected to be cultivated, it is likely that these companies will use less than they do already. This may even save them money.\\nWhile Lau says that she is ready to explore other alternatives for medicinal use, such as laser use of marijuana to treat other medical conditions, she offers not only a problem for people who want CBD and cismononic CBD, but also a potentially costly misuse of cannabis for cancer purposes.\\nA Facebook post on her blog post before Monday says she believes that medical marijuana products are becoming increasingly popular and they dont have to be used to treat diseases. Hemp products could also be used to help with the work of others struggling with pain, or for treatments of many conditions.\\nLau hopes that a ban on making synthetic cannabis products does this to get her experience. Earlier this year, at a press conference for her new book, she said that she was doing research to find out whether synthetic cannabis products could help relieve pain and inflammation, and if they could help people without the cannabinoids of the drug.\\nWe asked Lau about some products that she liked, and she said shes examining making those products.

Here\\'s the paragraph where they differentiate correlation/causation: Of course, association does not prove causation. However, one by one, alternative explanations have gradually been disproved.4 Patients do not start using cannabis to self-medicate their psychotic or prodromal symptoms or side-effects of drugs, but rather use it for the same reasons as the rest of the population, principally for its ‘high’. The risk of psychosis remains after controlling for personality disorder and use of other psychotogenic drugs. Some overlap between genes carrying susceptibility to schizophrenia and to drug use has been reported but insufficient to explain more than a fraction of the relationship.4This argument seems to based on self-reported motivations, controlling for diagnosed personality disorders, and controlling for other drug use. I\\'m not sure the fact that people express the desire to get high says much about why they\\'re taking a substance, and I think there\\'s a much broader range of \"sub-optimal\" mental states (that might lead one to self-medicate) than are regularly diagnosed.

The government actually *wants* to help you get off drugs.  he/she is going to use the more dangerous drug because of an inability to access the safer oneI think that would happen regardless of whether someones usual drug is legal or not.Your point is a valid one and commonly discussed. Weed is being legalized in a few places (I don't live in one and it may take a while to see the effects). Personally I think the only advantage to legalizing illicit drugs is to get revenue by taxing them. That's what they do with cigarettes, which is shit because cigarettes are so bad for peoples health.edit: spelling\": '7321.txt',\n",

However, the Discovery Channel is aiming to expose the states dark side in the new series Pot Cops, which follows a drug enforcement unit in Humboldt County, Calif. who work to bring down both cartels and the average Joe growers operating in the area. And thats no easy task. The drug trafficking organizations that generally come from Mexico will sometimes put booby traps coming [for] people that are trying to steal or for law enforcement trying to eradicate their crops. A drug cartel is a serious criminal organization, theres a lot of money to be made and when theres a lot of money to be made, there is a higher potential for violence, SWAT team member, Deputy Greg Musson who stars in the show told FOX411s Pop Tarts column. Obviously there is a level of the unknown One of the guys on the team and on the show has been involved in a shooting during a marijuana crackdown. Pot Cops will give audiences an unprecedented look at what it takes to conquer growers who are running a large weed farm in the Redwoods and shooting at local children on a reservation, as well as a bizarre, slow-speed chase of a stoned grower and investigations into parents who may be putting their own children at risk while hiding a huge grow somewhere in the surrounding hills. But what Musson anticipates viewers will be most surprised to learn more about is the heavily-debated medical marijuana issue, and he claims that in his decade-long career as a law enforcement officer, he can count on one hand the amount of legal growers he has encountered. We are not interested in interfering with people who have a legitimate marijuana license for their own personal use, and contrary to popular belief, it is not legal to grow marijuana for profit. It is illegal even with the license, Musson insisted. It is also illegal to give it away, just as it is to sell it. Even if you have a medical need. Thats the main thing we would like to get out there to people.': '241120231445.txt',\n",

The 20-year old pop star also took home the Best Video award for her hit song \"Wrecking Ball\" during a show with a strong lineup of other performers including Eminem and Katy Perry. Cyrus opened the space-themed show singing the song \"We Can\\'t Stop,\" while wearing a silver spandex suit and gyrating her buttocks in the move known as twerking in the general direction of her smaller female dance partner. To the delight of the crowd in Amsterdam\\'s Ziggo Dome, Cyrus finished the number by sticking out her tongue, the same expression she flashed repeatedly during her eyebrow-raising appearance at MTV\\'s Video Music Awards in New York in August. After winning the top award at the end of the show, she celebrated by demonstratively lighting up a large spliff and quickly taking a puff. Marijuana is not legal in the Netherlands, but smokers can\\'t be prosecuted for possessing small amounts and it is sold openly in cafes known euphemistically as \"coffee shops.\" However, that didn\\'t stop MTV from editing the incident out of the telecast that aired in America later Sunday evening.

Police say the actress was arrested in midtown Manhattan after she heaved a marijuana bong out of a window. The officers went to her apartment on the 36th floor where they said they saw heavy smoke and a bong sitting on the kitchen counter. They said she tossed the bong out the window in front of them, prosecutors said. She then said to police: \"It was just a vase,\" according to Manhattan assistant district attorney Chikaelo Ibeabuchi. \"My client completely denies illegally throwing anything out of her window,\" said Andrew Friedman, her attorney for the arraignment. Police say a building official called police to complain that Bynes was smoking marijuana and rolling a joint in the building\\'s lobby. An NYPD spokesperson told XXX the actress was then taken to Roosevelt Hospital to be evaluated. A source connected to the situation told XXX that while a full preliminary psychiatric evaluation was performed on Bynes, professionals found no reason to keep her on a medical hold. She was acting crazy, but there is no law against being crazy in the United States and they cant hold you for that. She is not suicidal, and not considered to be a danger to herself or society, explained the insider. They really tried to find a way to hold her, but no avail. Amanda isnt a dangerous girl, she seems desperate for attention and really acting out. After the evaluation, Bynes was taken the police station, where she spent the night. She pulled up to court Friday morning in a squad car where she was greeted by a crush of media. She was also charged with attempted tampering with evidence and unlawful possession of marijuana, all misdemeanors. \"I\\'m asking you I don\\'t want any pictures,\" she said to a photographer. \"I don\\'t want any photos. No press are allowed in here,\" she announced to the public courtroom. Bynes has gotten plenty of attention in recent months for her bizarre behavior.

She has been keeping fans up to date on her latest antics via Twitter, and she recently gained many followers after she posted a shockingly vulgar tweet about rapper Drake.

       "             'Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, is opposing Amendment 64, an issue on Colorados November ballot that would legalize, regulate, and tax the sale of marijuana. Hickenlooper said the Amendment would send the wrong message to children that using drugs is OK. Colorado is known for many things marijuana should not be one of them, Hickenlooper explained. Amendment 64 has the potential to increase the number of children using drugs and would detract from efforts to make Colorado the healthiest state in the nation. It sends the wrong message to kids that drugs are OK. The Obama campaign is worried members of his liberal base who support legalization will vote for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson (pictured), who supports legalization, while the Romney campaign is worried that libertarian-leaning voters who support the Amendment will also vote for Johnson. In a close race, the side who can best keep its voters from casting votes for Johnson will have the upper hand on Election Day. Hickenlooper and former Republican Gov. Bill Owens are opposed to the initiative while some conservatives like Tom Tancredo have come out for the Amendment. Tancredo, according to the Washington Times , has said at rallies that voting against the Amendment would be siding not just with the nanny-staters, but with the cartels. Groups in favor of Amendment 64 have stressed the economic benefits of marijuana legalization, saying the tax revenue after 2017 could top $100 million and support public services such as education. They have argued Mexican drug cartels currently get the money that could instead funnel into Colorados economy. The Denver Post editorialized that while Amendment 64 would limit marijuana sales to one ounce, it would be next to impossible to prevent out-of-state visitors from buying several ounces at various outlets and returning home, which could make Colorado a national magnet for marijuana users, growers and distributors. The Post has run a series of articles about how the pro-marijuana initiative could open a Pandoras Box of ills if it passess and make Colorado the destination for pot-dealers and smokers. A Public Policy Polling poll found 53% of Colorado voters support the initiative, while 43% were opposed. A Survey USA poll found 48% were in favor while 43% were not.': '170321175344.txt',\n",
       "             'Altering the course of U.S social policy, Maine and Maryland became the first states to approve same-sex marriage by popular vote, while Washington state and Colorado set up a showdown with federal authorities by legalizing recreational use of marijuana. The outcomes for those ballot measures Tuesday were a milestone for persistent but often thwarted advocacy groups and activists who for decades have pressed the causes of gay rights and drug decriminalization. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat who opposed legalization, was less enthused. Federal law still says marijuana is an illegal drug, so dont break out the Cheetos or gold fish too quickly, he said. The results in Maine and Maryland broke a 32-state streak, dating to 1998, in which gay marriage had been rebuffed by every state that voted on it. They will become the seventh and eighth states to allow same-sex couples to marry. In another gay-rights victory, Minnesota voters defeated a proposed constitutional amendment that would banned same-sex marriage in the state. Similar measures were approved in 30 other states, most recently in North Carolina in May. Washington state also voted on a measure to legalize same-sex marriage, though results were not expected until Wednesday at the soonest. The outcomes of the marriage votes could influence the U.S. Supreme Court, which will soon consider whether to take up cases challenging the law that denies federal recognition to same-sex marriages. The gay-rights victories come on the heels of numerous national polls that, for the first time, show a majority of Americans supporting same-sex marriage. Maines referendum marked the first time that gay-rights supporters put same-sex marriage to a popular vote. They collected enough signatures to schedule the vote, hoping to reverse a 2009 referendum that quashed a gay-marriage law enacted by the Legislature. In Maryland and Washington, gay-marriage laws were approved by lawmakers and signed by the governors this year, but opponents gathered enough signatures to challenge the laws. Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley, who campaigned vigorously for the marriage measure, spoke to a jubilant crowd in Baltimore. Christopher Wold, 31, danced with his partner of four years after the result became clear. He said they would like to marry now that its legal in Maryland. The president of the most active advocacy group opposing same-sex marriage, Brian Brown of the National Organization for Marriage, insisted Tuesdays results did not mark a watershed moment. Heading into the election, gay marriage was legal in six states and the District of Columbia in each case the result of legislation or court orders, not by a vote of the people. The marijuana measures in Colorado and Washington will likely pose a headache for the U.S. Justice Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration, which consider pot an illegal drug. The DOJ has declined to say how it would respond if the measures were approved. Colorados Amendment 64 will allow adults over 21 to possess up to an ounce of marijuana, though using the drug publicly would be banned. The amendment would allow people to grow up to six marijuana plants in a private, secure area. Washingtons measure establishes a system of state-licensed marijuana growers, processors and stores, where adults can buy up to an ounce. It also establishes a standard blood test limit for driving under the influence. The Washington measure was notable for its sponsors and supporters, who ranged from public health experts and wealthy high-tech executives to two former top Justice Departments officials in Seattle, U.S. Attorneys John McKay and Kate Pflaumer. Estimates show pot taxes could bring in hundreds of millions of dollars a year, but the sales wont start until state officials make rules to govern the legal weed industry. The Washington measure was opposed by Derek Franklin, president of the Washington Association for Substance Abuse and Violence Prevention. In Oregon, a marijuana-legalization measure was defeated. In Massachusetts, voters approved a measure to allow marijuana use for medical reasons, joining 17 other states. Arkansas voters rejected a similar measure. In all, 176 measures were on the ballots Tuesday in 38 states, according to the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California. Other notable results: Maryland voters approved a measure allowing illegal immigrants to pay in-state college tuition, provided they attended a state high school for three years and can show they filed state income tax returns during that time. About a dozen other states have similar laws, but Marylands is the first to be approved by voters. In Oklahoma, voters approved a Republican-backed measure that wipes out all affirmative action programs in state government hiring, education and contracting practices. Similar steps have been taken previously in Arizona, California, Michigan, Nebraska and Washington. In Michigan, labor unions suffered a big loss. Voters rejected a first-of-its-kind ballot initiative that would have put collective bargaining rights in the state constitution.': '170321175346.txt',\n",

       "             'Corey Feldman is trying to set the record straight about his recent run-in with the law in Louisiana. The star took to Twitter after multiple outlets reported that he was arrested for possession of illegal marijuana. The former child-star, 46, was on his way to a gig with his band when their bus was pulled over for speeding. According to The News Star , the officer searched the vehicle after detecting the smell of marijuana. Feldman and the rest of the people traveling with him were arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession of marijuana, driving under a suspension and speeding. Because the charges werent felonies, he was able to pay the $640 fine rather than posting bond. On Sunday, the star took to Twitter, where he explained his side of the story in a series of all-caps tweets. HI #EVERYBODY & HAPPY 22ND! 4 THE RECORD, I WAS NOT ARRESTED OR PUT IN JAIL.

Feldman went on to say that his band is continuing its tour, stopping to raise money for Houston next. As Us Weekly notes, his statement about the timing of the situation being ironic likely has to do with the fact that he recently spoke out against disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, propelling him back into national attention.

       "             'A state official has reluctantly added post-traumatic stress disorder to the list of conditions that qualify for medical marijuana in Michigan. Steve Arwood, who heads the agency that oversees the program, said hes following the recommendation of an advisory panel, especially the affirmative vote of Michigans chief medical executive, Dr. Matthew Davis. I do remain very concerned with the scope of this approval and the process in general. First, the condition of PTSD is a mental health issue. Granting this approval steps Michigan away from the use of marijuana for disease of the body or chronic pain symptoms of a physical nature, Arwood said in an order dated last Friday. PTSD is considered a mental health condition linked to a terrifying event. Since Michigan voters approved it in 2008, marijuana typically has been used to relieve the side effects of cancer, glaucoma, HIV, hepatitis C and a few other conditions. PTSD is the first condition to be added to the original list, although seven other states allow doctors to recommend marijuana to treat the disorder. Michigan users of medical marijuana need a doctors diagnosis and a card from the state. More than 100,000 people have cards, including 86 who are under age 18, according to the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.

       "             'Last year, the FDA recognized a new drug for epilepsy made from marijuanas own CBD, otherwise known as cannabidiol . That means the marijuana plant may have a confirmed medical use after all. So what about medical marijuana and diabetes? Can diabetics use the drug to help their condition or safely use it for pleasure? As more states legalize medical marijuana, people with all kinds of diseases are wondering this same question. However, diabetics are left reading between the lines of existing studies to make a conclusion. The short answer: experts dont know for sure. People with diabetes can discuss how to safely use medical marijuana with their doctors. However, the research is slim and sometimes opposing on whether the drug actually helps diabetes. One large study published in The American Journal of Medicine points to positive benefits for diabetes. The study was conducted on over 4,600 participants using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey(NHANES) survey. Of those participating, about 580 used marijuana regularly and over 1,900 had used it in the past. Interestingly, researchers found that using marijuana was associated with a lower fasting insulin level and a smaller waist size. A review published in the Natural Medicine Journal also highlighted positive outcomes. The review cited the NHANES study as well as several mice models that suggest cannabis protected mice from getting diabetes or reduced its severity. The review also pointed out a study in Israel that revealed a low dose of THC, well below its psychoactive capabilities, could protect the body against organ damage. But there are studies showing negative effects too. One such study published by the American Diabetes Association showed that marijuana users tended to consume about 20 percent more food, eat a lesser quality diet involving simple carbs, have higher blood pressure and have a higher percentage of visceral fat. All of these markers could exacerbate diabetes risk. To balance these findings, though, the same study did find that marijuana users had lower overall fat content and a lower BMI. Other possible (largely unproven) benefits of medical marijuana that many cannabis advocates commonly highlight: Reducing anxiety, Reducing pain and inflammation, Slowing cancer growth, Muscle relaxant, which could be helpful for multiple sclerosis, Controlling side effects of chemotherapy, such as nausea and vomiting. Officially, the National Institute on Drug Abuse states that not enough large-scale studies have been conducted to provide definitive answers about medical marijuana. One thing is certain, though: In light of the new wave of cannabis interest, this is a field of study researchers cannot overlook. The difficult task is to conduct such research under available laws, which prohibit the use and study of marijuana by the federal government. Researchers will need to take care to go the proper pathways so that more research can become available and recognized.': '050121173120.txt',\n",

       "             'A recent insurance study links increased car crash claims to legalized recreational marijuana. The Highway Loss Data Institute, a leading insurance research group, said in study results released Thursday that collision claims in Colorado, Washington, and Oregon went up 2.7 percent in the years since legal recreational marijuana sales began when compared with surrounding states. Legal recreational pot sales in Colorado began in January 2014, followed six months later in Washington, and in October 2015 in Oregon. \"We believe that the data is saying that crash risk has increased in these states and those crash risks are associated with the legalization of marijuana,\" said Matt Moore, senior vice president with the institute, which analyzes insurance data to observe emerging auto-safety trends. Mason Tvert, a marijuana legalization advocate and communications director with the Marijuana Policy Project, questioned the study\\'s comparison of claims in rural states such as Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana with Colorado, Oregon and Washington that have dense population centers and how that affected the study\\'s findings. \"The study raises more questions than it provides answers, and it\\'s an area that would surely receive more study, and deservedly so,\" Tvert said. Researchers accounted for factors such as the number of vehicles on the road in the study and control states, age and gender of drivers, weather and even whether the driver making a claim was employed. Neighboring states with similar fluctuations in claims were used for comparison. Insurance industry groups have been keeping a close watch on claims when auto accidents across the country began to go up in 2013 after more than a decade of steady decline. Insurance companies found several possible factors at play in the spike that included distracted driving through texting or cellphone use, road construction, and an improved economy that has led to leisurely drives and more miles driven, as well as marijuana legalization. \"It would appear, probably not to anyone\\'s surprise, that the use of marijuana contributes to crashes,\" said Kenton Brine, president of the industry group Northwest Insurance Council that represents companies in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. He added: \"It would be difficult to say that marijuana is a definitive factor, lacking a citation, in a significant number of crashes to say that what we\\'re seeing here is a trend.\" The Highway Loss Data Institute said its study examined claims from January 2012 to October 2016. \"The problem here is that it\\'s a pretty new experience,\" said Carole Walker of the Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Association, an industry group that covers Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico. \"This is the first study that has been able to isolate legal pot as one of the factors.\" Eight states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana for adults. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety spokesman Russ Rader adds that alcohol impairment remains one of the biggest concerns on the road. \"While we have proven countermeasures, proven strategies for reducing alcohol impaired driving, there are a lot of unanswered questions about marijuana and driving,\" Rader said. A study released last year by AAA\\'s safety foundation found legal THC limits established by states with legal marijuana have no scientific basis and can result in innocent drivers being convicted, and guilty drivers being released. Moore of the Highway Loss Data Institute said they hope the study\\'s findings will be considered by lawmakers and regulators in states where marijuana legalization is under consideration or recently enacted.': '050121173109.txt',\n",

Medical marijuana is legal in 17 states, but the industry has a decidedly black-market aspect its mostly cash-only. Thats because banks wont touch pot money. (AP Photo/Ed Andrieski) Theyre scrambling for space to grow marijuana in Denver. The demand is so great that warehouse space is renting for four times the price it fetched before marijuana sales began in Colorado, the Denver Post reports. Commercial real estate tracker Xceligent Inc. estimates that marijuana cultivation and manufacturing facilities in the city occupy about 4.5 million square feet the equivalent of 78 football fields. This industry has come on so fast that initially I was uneasy it seemed like a fad, said Brad Calbert, president of the Colliers International brokerage in Denver. But whats making it sustainable is supply, demand and capital. Supply is deficient, demand is excessive, and capital is abundant. But recreational marijuana sales brought in only $2 million in tax revenue in January, according the figures from thestates Department of Revenue. That represents about $14 million worth of pot, sold from about 59 businesses. According to the Washington Posts Niraj Chokshi : When compared to expectations for the first six months of the year, January sales appear discouraging. If they hold for the remainder of the fiscal year, the state will see about $21 million in revenue. A mid-2013 fiscal analysis of the proposal that became the law, however, foresaw an additional $33.5 million in revenue generated in the first six months of the year. An estimate last month from Gov. John Hickenloopers (D) budget office predicted revenues of about $35.2 million. The new tax figures are the first official accounting of pot sales since they began on Jan. 1 under a new Colorado law enacted in 2012. The state of Washington has also legalized marijuana sales but legal retailing hasnt started up there yet. There are numerous reports of pot being sold via Craigslist and other sites, however, with customers ordering it up as if it were pizza. Washington issued its first legal marijuana growing and processing license last week, according to the Associated Press . It was issued to Sean Green, who has previously operated medicalmarijuanadispensaries in Spokane as well as the Seattle suburb of Shoreline. Green is the chief executive of Spokanes Kouchlock Productions. The state is set to issue retail licenses later this spring, with sales expected to begin in June or July.

(Mike Stobe/Getty Images for USTA/) Mike Tyson is on the verge of becoming a heavyweight in Californias burgeoning marijuana industry. The former boxer and some business partners have broken ground on a 40-acre ranch in the state that they envision as a destination for growers and consumers of newly legal weed. California, which had allowed licensed medical marijuana use, legalized recreational pot Jan. 1, and Tyson is looking to capitalize in a big way. The Blast reported Monday that the 51-year-old former heavyweight champion broke ground last month on a cannabis resort to be locatedin California City, a town in the Mojave Desert about a 110-mile drive north from Los Angeles. The location is also a much shorter drive north from Edwards Air Force Base, and according to The Blast, taking care of men and women who have served in the armed forces is a top priority forTysonHolistic, the company that will operate the resort, to be called Tyson Ranch. The Blast noted that cannabidiol, a marijuana extract that does notprovide the highfamously associated with tetrahydrocannabinol, has been used by some veterans to treat cases ofpost-traumatic stress disorder, and it is touted by advocates as having other therapeutic properties as well. Tyson Ranch will reportedly set aside 20 acres for the cultivation of marijuana by master growers, while the property will also feature facilities to help the growers and those interested in becoming one. In addition, the ranch will offer an edibles factory, an amphitheater and areas for glamping . The groundbreaking ceremony included two of Tysons business partners,Robert Hickman and Jay Strommen,andCalifornia City Mayor Jennifer Wood. She said the ranch would help engineer a rebirth for her town, a planned city that never flourished in the way its1950s developers envisioned. Hickman told The Blast that the undeveloped lands in California City are primed to be cultivated. The city has sought to boost its economy in recent years by attracting marijuana-related businesses. Tyson has spoken in the past about using marijuana extensively during his boxing career, as well as having been addicted at times to cocaine. His October 2000 win by technical knockout over Andrew Golota was subsequently changed to no contest after Tyson tested positive for marijuana. More from The Post: Isaiah Thomas is back.

John Hickenlooper said at the time. \"The question we all have is how long the process for medicinal cannabis in Colorado will take.\"\\nSome experts consider Colorado the first state in the country to consider the status of medical marijuana. That stance is designed to stall a federal legal weed market the state has been wrestling with for years.\\nSo far, states in the nation where medical marijuana has legalized have shown a jump in demand. Most legal states have legalized marijuana for recreational use and two states, Utah and Washington, are now legalizing medical marijuana.\\nIn Washington, which licenses dispensaries for medical-marijuana purposes, the expansion of medical marijuana dispensaries is slated to bring tens of thousands of patients over to the Washington State dispensary scene, according to the Washington Post.\\n\"Colorado has been recognized as a real victory in this debate over constitutional amendments and medical marijuana with recent polls showing that two-thirds of Americans believe medical marijuana is a medical treatment that can help treat all of our conditions,\" Obama advisor Christina Romer said Monday.\\nWhite House spokesperson Josh Earnest said that border control deals forged\\nPresident Obamas push to improve safety along the U.S.-Mexico border went down a road not unlike that of marijuana laws his administration used to resolve the ongoing immigration enforcement crisis there.\\nIn recent weeks, the president, speaking Monday in Indiana, put that defeat in context:\\n\"What it does say is that the federal government has demonstrated  as I said before  that it has a responsibility to protect the American people in terms of border security.

They want the senator to step aside and pave the way for his judicial nomination and other conflicts of interest. Thats the right strategy, but maybe Sessions gets it.\\nSessions and his allies seized upon Trumps acceptance of his nomination earlier this month to use his new position as FBI Director to gain an arsenal of legal and legal powers against the Department of Justice, which Trump said is trying to kill his health care law. That came as the Trump administration scolded a New York judge for holding a hearing to address President Barack Obamas new order mandating sanctuary cities around the country to keep criminals from reporting to immigration enforcement.\\nThey accused Sessions of deliberately staying out of a criminal case in which the Court ultimately sided with two lying scolds, Eric Holder and Robert Mueller. The lawyers delivered the statements in the closing argument in a 10-day hearing, in which the Justice Department defended Sessions as deferential to the Bureau of Justice Statistics on immigration, arguing that it has no authority to function in the manner Sessions intended.\\nAfter Sessionss attorney general issued an email, arguing that the DJS is not working, Justice Department acting Chief Counsel David Boies defended the agency in a Thursday tweet of his own: The DJS has eight cases at the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts and no recusal from cases.  The Justice Department takes no position on any of the Courts decisions.\\nThat didnt stop Twitter users from wondering where Sessions stood on the central issue thats bedeviling the political realm now.\\nAs the conservative people at the Justice Department have tweeted, Sessionss motives arent to save Obamacare, much less to get rid of it or get rid of the SCOTUS itself. His post-op counterparts have been using that foreign policy argument to tamp down on the Obamacare litigation  the focus of any Trump nominee with a history of being an inveterate con man.\\nIf Sessions were serious about getting rid of Obamacare and other Republican health care bills, he would announce early this fall that the White House is out to kill the replacement.\\nMocking that by appearing out of touch with his viewers on Twitter, Sessions told a group of Texas local news reporters and reporters that the House health bill fails to cut costs and even that a majority of its provisions do not roll back employer mandates and other reforms.\\nSessionss decision to avoid being asked to explain how Congress can repeal Obamacare will help to keep federal prosecutors from trying protesters in a federal courthouse, and to put pressure on the Justice Department to oppose the health law before Sessions nominates his nominee for attorney general, which Trumps pick, Robert Mueller, would be.\\nIts not likely to happen: Sessionss attorney general would take some heat for his actions, including lashing out at the Democratic leaderships obstruction of justice by saying that the Justice Departments chief counsel had revoked federal warrant warrants, a move that would seem like the most direct entry into how Trump thinks the U.S. government will execute federal warrants issued in his and other White House agencies.\\nIf his bench scowls come to be predictable, conservative folks will probably be pissed as hell. In one sense, people have spent decades banging and kicking Sessions over Justice Department shenanigans. The Randian logic says its now lawful to provide information to the FBI under law, and the FBI chief gets to refuse access to such information, too.\\nIts worth noting that Sessions and Justice Department lawyers indicated they would begin their defense of Sessions by threatening to take him to the Supreme Court if Trump doesnt give the nominee a seat on the high court. But then the publication of that letter suggests that Sessions is overly concerned about losing a job.\\nHe is, after all, a conservative icon with empathy for the poor and uninsured  a skill that Sessions has relished along the way. Sessions has said he believes in the liberty of individual rights, but he has also said that any restrictions on how religious facilities are licensed in the United States are unconstitutional. Hes a conservative hardliner and occasionally exceeds that hard line.\\nIts just interesting how they keep bending over backwards to try to pile pressure on him. People have been saying Sessions is trying to get rid of Obamacare for years  although he hasnt even tried it himself.\\nMaybe people just dont buy Sessionss logic.\\n': '291020230501.txt',\n",
       "             'Follow @NirajC Tyler Williams of Blanchester, Ohio, selects marijuana strains to purchase in Colorado. (Theo Stroomer/Getty) Adult Coloradans consume roughly 121 metric tons of marijuana a year, according to a new Colorado Department of Revenue study that estimates demand at31 percent more than a recent projection and virtuallydouble some outside estimates. The study, released this week,sought to ascertain how often and how much pot is consumed by the states adult residents and visitors. What they found was that there are 485,000 regular adult users of marijuana, a group that accounts for roughly9 percent ofthe states forecast 2014 population. Toss in adult residents who have used the drug in the past year and estimates of those under 21 years old who have used in the past year and that share rises to more than 15 percent of the population. Thestudy is unique in that, according to the authors, its the first to look at both demand and supply. Measuring supply is convenient becausesales data is recorded, but it leaves outthe significant role of black market, home-grown and imported marijuana. Measuring demand gives a better sense of how much of the drug is in use. While the amount of underground and illegal production is expected to decline significantly, some level is believed to exist to date, the authors write.Therefore, in order to determine the total market for licensed and unlicensed marijuana, a demand approach is more practical. To measure demand, the researchers first estimated the number of users and then the amount consumed by each over a given period of time. But that just gives an estimate of how often people are using, not how much. To measure demand, they relied on surveys. And becausethere are myriad ways to consume pot, each with varying potency, theymeasured by dried flower weight. Heres a tour of some of the reports conclusions about marijuana use in Colorado, seven months after legal sales began there: About 9 percent of adultsareprojected to use marijuana at least once a month The state predicts that 485,000 adults consume the drug at least once a month, translating to about 9 percent of the forecast population for the year. Another 201,000 reported using it in the past year, roughly 3.8 percent of the population.And while the report focuses on adult use, the report did mention an estimated 184,000 residents under 21 years old who have used the drug within the past year. Frequency of pot use is concentrated at the extremes Adult residents either smoke pot (relatively)few times a monthor nearly every daythere are few in the middle. More than half of all adult resident users consume the drug in some form fewer than six times a month. (More than 1 in 4 consume less than once a month.) At the same time, about 1 in 5 users are near or at daily consumption. Frequent users consume the vast majority of marijuana While those roughly daily users account for just a fifth of the userpopulation, they consume fully two thirds of the product.

       "             'at 9:30 AM A Ben & Jerrys Chill-aco (Photo by Greg Comollo) When you and your buds get the munchies on April 20, the high holidayfor marijuana users, a small army of marketing professionals is working to ensure that in your haze, you\\'ll reach for their brand of blazed, er, glazed doughnuts. Or Totino\\'s Pizza Rolls. Or Burger King. Or any other brand of junk food even from a wholesome, family-friendly company thatsuspects its biggest fans may be spending the day more flame-broiled than a Whopper. 4/20, as the holiday is known, is when brands want you toget baked (goods). They want you to have a huge (ice cream) bowl or a (burrito) roll.In other words, it\\'s the day when corporate-sanctioned pot punsfly high on Twitter. It\\'s no surprise that Ben & Jerry\\'s, the tie-dyed Vermont ice cream maker that has namedice creams \"Half Baked\" and \"Phish Food\" and \"Dave Matthews Band Magic Brownies,\" wouldcapitalize on the spirit of 4/20.\"Jerry and Ben started the company in 1978, and they were definitely two hippies that were enjoying life, if you will,\" said spokeswomanLindsay Bumps. Two years ago, on 4/20, the brand\\'s scoop shops debuted the Brrr-ito, an ice-cream filled burrito that definitely seems like a late-night stoner innovation. This year, they\\'re introducing another new menu item: The Chill-aco, a waffle-cone taco with two scoops of ice cream and fudgedrizzle, \"which gives it that ooey-gooey component,\" Bumps said. \"I think a lot of brands aim to stand out on that day.\" Related: [Dank and resinous, this is the 4/20 beer youve been searching for] The same goes for Lagunitas. The northern California brewery, owned in part by Heineken , is bringing back its Waldos\\' Ale, a beer that Washington Post beer columnistFritz Hahn called \" the stickiest of the icky .\" The Waldos were a group of students who are said to havecoined the term 420 in the 1970s and who worked with the brewery to develop the beer\\'s dank flavor. It\\'s\"one of our best selling beers,\" said spokeswomanKaren Hamilton. Alluding to marijuana in names for beer is \"just something that we\\'ve always done, and it\\'s not only on April 20.\" But it\\'s not just companies from the liberal enclaves of California and Vermont who are partaking in 4/20 marketing campaigns. It\\'s also big, mainstream brands, such as Pepsi , Chipotle, Burger King and Denny\\'s, all of whom have alludedto 4/20 on social media in previous years. If you make food that\\'s baked, or comes in a bowl, well, thead copy writes itself. Denny\\'s tweeted its favorite, allegedly culinary words: \"Baked, cooked, fried, stewed, toasted.\" Chipotle\\'s photo of a burrito bowl came with the caption, \"Sometimes you need a huge bowl to get you through the day.\" Why are they so coy about it though? Even as more states legalize marijuana,acknowledging 4/20 can still be atricky business move. So brands do it with a wink and a nudge for consumers who know that \"fried\" doesn\\'t exactly refer to chicken,but they stop just short of spelling it out in fear of pushing away their othercustomers. Case in point: Ask any one of these brands what it is, exactly, thatpeople are celebrating on 4/20, and you\\'ll make tricky work for its spokesmen, whohaveto acknowledge the \"holiday,\" but don\\'t want to cross a line for their corporation by actually, you know, acknowledging the holiday. Which leads to clinically worded, coded emails like this one, from Totino\\'s Pizza Rolls spokesman MikeSiemienas: \"Totino\\'s does some regional promotions focused on current events in specific markets ,\" he said. \"We are running a similar campaign this year by celebrating our fans who love pizza rolls.\" Related: [Pizza chains are making a desperate push to avoid posting calories on menus] But pizza isn\\'t the only thing that\\'s going to be rolling on Thursday right, Mike? Ever the professional, he will not budge.\"This current event is relevant to our pizza roll fans in Colorado so that makes it important to us,\" Siemienas said in a subsequent email, studiously avoiding the words \"marijuana\" and \"4/20.\" It\\'s pretty clear that the brand knows its audience isn\\'t just time-strapped moms and hungry kids. Some of the taglines that Totino\\'s will be using in its advertising this week will include:\"Remember before you forget,\" \"It\\'s high time for some Pizza Rolls,\" and the very Keanu Reeves-esque , \"It\\'s pizza. In a roll. Whoa.\" They\\'ve also filmed a riff on \"A Christmas Carol,\" except when Scrooge wakes up in the morning and looks out the window, astonished that he hasn\\'t missed the big day 4/20, of course heinquires not about the prizeturkey in the window, but about the availability of pizza rolls. It ends with the hashtag #betterwhenbaked. Other brands practice flat-out denial. \"We\\'re really known for our tongue-in-cheek humor but it\\'s pretty coincidental that it\\'s coming out on the 20th,\" said Bumps, the Ben & Jerry\\'s spokeswoman. \"That\\'s the official line.\" Butprofessionals in the cannabis industry don\\'t love the pile-on from junk-food brands, which they say promotes negative stereotypes about the lifestyle. Cannabis \"is becominga wellness product. We do not want people to believe that you just get munchies, and you\\'re just reaching for junk food. It\\'s part of a healthy lifestyle,\" said Olivia Mannix, chief executive of Cannabrand , a marketingagency for cannabis companies. Related: [An Irish restaurant chain is upset that McDonalds owns so many Mc trademarks] The branding pile-on is also, for cannabis connoisseurs, a sign that their holiday is becoming as commercialized as Christmas or Valentine\\'s Day.\"It\\'s just another holiday for brands to jump on the bandwagon to market themselves,\" said Mannix, and already, thebig brands\\' pot jokes are played-out cliches.\"It\\'s going to take a lot to be clever. A lot of the things have been said and done.\" College kids might get a chuckle out of that burrito that looks like a joint , but cannabis consumers are more than just the \"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle\" crowd, said J.J. Walker, the founder of My420Tours , a travel company that\\'shosting World Cannabis Week in Colorado April 19 through 23 . \"The bottom line is, this is a really good spending demographic\" that encompasses \"everything from your 21-year-old stoner, to CEOs, to your grandma,\" Walker said. \"Once these brands get over themselves and realize what cannabis can do, I think you\\'re going to see a lot of brands coming on board.\" In the meantime,don\\'t expect the digital marketing teams behind your favoritebrands to be, well, blunt. Bumps says that even though Ben & Jerry\\'s has a good sense of humor on Twitter, they have to be careful not to go too far. \"Wetry to get almost to that line, but we never really cross that line,\" Bumps said.

       "             'Americans who worship at the altar of marijuana had better not look to the First Amendment\\'s guarantee of religious freedom to keep them out of jail, suggests one recent case. That message was sent by the Florida Supreme Court to the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, a Miami sect that uses marijuana as an integral part of its worship service. The U.S. Supreme Court has shown no inclination to send a different message since it refused even to consider the issue. Florida and U.S. officials have mounted a pincer attack against the Coptics. State authorities obtained an injunction against a church member barring her from using her home as a church, in violation of zoning regulations. It also prhibits the use of marijuana there. vThe Florida Supreme Court upheld the injunction. The other half of the attack is being played out in a federal district court in Miami, where other church members are being prosecuted on charges of violating federal drug prohibitions. The trials were scheduled to get under way this month, although legal maneuvering has caused postponement until at least February. The Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is not the first religious group in U.S. history to encounter difficulties in its attempts to find religious freedom. Many of the early colonies, though populated by settlers fleeing religious persecution in Europe, were not safe havens for groups who came with rites and rituals different than those already established. In an attempt to end intolerance in the New World, the guarantee of freedom of religion received star billing in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights -- prohibiting Congress and later individual states as well, from interfering with the free exercise of religion. Nurtured by the protection of the First Amendment, various cults and religions sprang up. Snake handlers, poison drinkers and mystics of all kinds flourished in some of the atypicalsects. The mix of drugs and religion is familiar to the region, dating back to ancient Indian rites. The flower children of the \\'60s incorporated marijuana and hallucinogens into their forms of worship. The Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church comes closer to the Indian experience than to the religions that sprang up a decade or so ago. While the Constitution clearly allows legal authorities to prosecute persons who claim religious beliefs solely as a cover to engage in illegal activities, the constitutionality is not so apparent where the illegal activity is an integral part of the worship service of a group that meets existing legal standards as a religion. And while marijuana is an important part of the rite of the Coptic Church, its doctrine extends to other matters. Even the Florida Supreme Court found the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church to be authentic religion as with regard to the First Amendment to the Constitution. The Miami-based Coptic group claims links with the 6,000 year-old Coptic Church, but its more recent origins can be traced to the Rastafarians of Marcus Garvey\\'s movement urging American blacks to look to Africa as a holy land. Rastafarianism called itself after Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie\\'s name as a commoner. Selassie\\'s crowning as emperor was seen as the fulfillment of Garvey\\'s prophecy to \"Look to Africa when a black king shall be crowned, for the day of deliverance is near.\" Restafarians established settlements in Jamaica where believers lived together and convened to worship together. One of these missions became known as the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, whose doctrine feature is a process called \"reasoning,\" which involves a philosophical and theological dialogue accompanied by the smoking of marijuana. Marijuana is the sacrament of the church, replacing wine as the symbolic spirit of Christ. Deemed the spiritual power which unites men in one spirit, marijuana is smoked by church members three times a day, during morning, afternoon and evening worship services. Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church members contend that through marijuana or \"ganja,\" its Jamaican name, man is able to look at God by looking within himself, the embodiment of God on earth. Attorney Milton M. Ferrell, Jr., who represents the Coptics in their legal battles, contended in a telephone interview that church members adhere to such strict doctrines and dietary laws that others are hardly likely to adopt the Coptic\\'s way of life just to smoke marijuana. Having qualified as a legitimate church, the Coptics cleared their first legal hurdle but there remained one indisputable point: Governmental interference with religious practice is permissable if the state can \"demonstrate a compelling interest\" superceding the constitutional protection. To establish such a compelling interest, a state cannot offer just any reasonable justification. It must be one that is sufficient to overcome the strong policy in favor of not interfering with religious practices. For instance, constitutional protection of the freedom of religion clause takes a back seat when life is at stake or when a substantial health emergency threatens a community. Ordering medical care for an endangered child despite religious objections by the parents is an example of this kind of compelling interest. Other infringements that have passed constitutional muster are the compulsion that an individual be vaccinated despite objections based on religious handling of poisonous snakes. The Florida Supreme Court found the legislature\\'s determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug sufficiently compelling to negate the church members\\' constitutional rights. This is not the type of strict scrutiny to which government attempts to regulate First Amendment rights are usually subjected, especially in light of the many medical experts that the church had rounded up to contest the finding of \"dangerousness.\" The ill effects of marijuana remain a debatable issue. While states may freely ban its common use, interference with it in a religious context should require more convincing proof. Florida courts undoubtedly were influenced against the church by the claim that the Coptics freely distributed marijuana to \"children and adults, members and nonmembers.\" The Florida Supreme Court was thus able to distinguish the Coptics\\' claim from an earlier case where the California Supreme Court prohibited the state from interfering with the use of peyote by adult Navajo Indians as part of their religion. Attoney Farrell charged that the finding of casual distribution was based upon only one instance when a nonmember juvenile smoked marijuana at a church service, a youth who had gained entry by lying to guards posted by the Coptics, he said. While most of us are unlikely to take the cause of the Coptics seriously, the guarantee of religious freedom is not reserved for those religions to which the majority of us subscribe. In fact, the real worth of any constitutional protection may be determined by how well it guarantees the rights of people on the fringe. When the criminal trials begin in Miami, at stake will be the freedom of church members as well as the religious liberty of the Coptics. tPerhaps the possibility of prison sentences being meted out will result in the application of the more serious First Amendment test to the Coptics\\' claim. business Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.': '291020230504.txt',\n",
       "             'Scientists who conducted a rare study of marijuana in California say it will affect how people think about marijuana and drive.\\nScientists from the University of California, Santa Cruz said Tuesday that marijuana is good for you, that its psychoactive compounds might have been proven by their use among people who have been diagnosed with certain type of epilepsy and also studies whether drivers can lower their risk of a heart attack or stroke.\\nUnder California law, marijuana can be used to protect against risks such as that of developing a heart attack or stroke or to prevent unwanted overdoses. If marijuana-induced liver and kidney damage results in death, the person can be prosecuted.\\nThis is a potential driver  its scary, UC Santa Cruz professor Kenneth Pereira said in a statement. The opposite of where this ban should be should be it be allowed.  Like it or not, people in this country should be concerned about regulating the purchase and use of marijuana.\\nThe researchers tested a single molecule in marijuana and found that specific molecules called f-14, a precursor ingredient in marijuana, had helped prove the safety of marijuana using cannabinoids and its sugar. Pereira said that other researchers found that THC, or the active ingredient in marijuana, may have a calming effect on people.\\nThe most positive drug side effects are when their patients are happy and dont need additional medications, he said.\\nPereira said he had been surprised by some research that seeks to ban marijuana. In one study, researchers said people whose parents provide marijuana were much more likely to smoke it and cause disruptions in sleep, causing the sniffles and increased anxiety. Another study of 32 people randomly selected found the effects of marijuana was more than three times more likely to change the quality of an individuals sleep than did the prevalence of normal hallucinations or seizures.\\nThis is really one of those things that if this is in the mainstream, it will never be banned. Just because its so restrictive doesnt mean we wont have some to talk about, Pereira said.\\nThis is just another example of that, you know. You could argue that if you look at the evidence, its just low quality cannabis, but this really disturbs me because it reminds me of some other issues.\\nJeff Brown of the Australian National University said he is not convinced the use of marijuana has made any difference for behavior, nor are its negative effects due to it being made into a poor product.\\nThe impact is purely on the pockets, its not making the marketplace available, he said. In many cases, theres a diversion. There are a million types of people who want to smoke marijuana. Is it safe? Totally safe? Absolutely not. So the question is: If its good for you, shouldnt it be OK? If its not, arent we doing this in the wrong kind of an area?\\nThe Senate voted to ban marijuana and take steps to increase penalties, but that didnt happen.\\nFacebook representative Patrick Emmons said he doesnt think banning the drug is necessary.\\n\"If you look at whether or not [marijuana] meets the federal legal requirements, thats where the potential for misuse and harm outweighs the benefits,\" Emmons said in a statement. \"Its about time that there were more protections in place to protect public health.\\nA statement on California law\\'s impact from Berkeley University\\'s Rebecca FitzGerald said the scientists have chosen to study marijuana in California not because it has been used, but because changes within its structure and quality are likely to be felt and tweaked in the context of government regulation.\\nMore On This...

       "             'Six states that allow marijuana use have legal tests to determine driving while impaired by the drug that have no scientific basis, according to a study by the nation\\'s largest automobile club that calls for scrapping those laws. The study commissioned by AAA\\'s safety foundation said it\\'s not possible to set a blood-test threshold for THC, the chemical in marijuana that makes people high, that can reliably determine impairment. Yet the laws in five of the six states automatically presume a driver guilty if that person tests higher than the limit, and not guilty if it\\'s lower. As a result, drivers who are unsafe may be going free while others may be wrongly convicted, the foundation said. The foundation recommends replacing the laws with ones that rely on specially trained police officers to determine if a driver is impaired, backed up by a test for the presence of THC rather than a specific threshold. The officers are supposed to screen for dozens of indicators of drug use, from pupil dilation and tongue color to behavior. The foundation\\'s recommendation to scrap the laws in Colorado, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington comes as legislatures in several more states consider adopting similar laws. At least three states, and possibly as many as eleven, will also vote this fall on ballot measures to legalize marijuana for either recreational or medicinal use, or both. Several legislatures are also considering legalization bills. \"There is understandably a strong desire by both lawmakers and the public to create legal limits for marijuana impairment in the same manner we do alcohol,\" said Marshall Doney, AAA\\'s president and CEO. \"In the case of marijuana, this approach is flawed and not supported by scientific research.\" Determining whether someone is impaired by marijuana, as opposed to having merely used the drug at some time, is far more complex than the simple and reliable tests that have been developed for alcohol impairment. There\\'s no science that shows drivers become impaired at a specific level of THC in the blood. A lot depends upon the individual. Drivers with relatively high levels of THC in their systems might not be impaired, especially if they are regular users, while others with relatively low levels may be unsafe behind the wheel. Some drivers may be impaired when they are stopped by police, but by the time their blood is tested they have fallen below the legal threshold because active THC dissipates rapidly. The average time to collect blood from a suspected driver is often more than two hours because taking a blood sample typically requires a warrant and transport to a police station or hospital, the foundation said. In addition, frequent marijuana users can exhibit persistent levels of the drug long after use, while THC levels can decline more rapidly among occasional users. Nine states, including some that have legalized marijuana for medicinal use, have zero-tolerance laws for driving and marijuana that make not only the presence of THC in a driver\\'s blood illegal, but also the presence of its metabolites, which can linger for weeks after use. That makes no sense, said Mark A. R. Kleiman, a New York University professor specializing in issues involving drugs and criminal policy. \"A law against driving with THC in your bloodstream is not a law you can know you are obeying except by never smoking marijuana or never driving,\" he said. He said rather than switching to a new kind of law as AAA recommends, states should consider simply making it a traffic violation. Studies show that using marijuana and driving roughly doubles the risk of a crash, Kleiman said. By comparison, talking on a hands-free cellphone while driving legal in all states quadruples crash risk, he said. A blood alcohol content of .12, which is about the median amount in drunken driving cases, increases crash risk by about 15 times, he said. Driving with \"a noisy child in the back of the car\" is about as dangerous as using marijuana and driving, Kleiman said. The exception is when a driver has both been using marijuana and drinking alcohol because the two substances together greatly heighten impairment, he said. The foundation also released a second study that found the share of drivers in fatal crashes who had recently used marijuana doubled in Washington after the state legalized it for recreational use in December 2012. From 2013 to 2014, the share of drivers who had recently used marijuana rose from 8 percent to 17 percent. While it stopped short of blaming the crashes on that increase, AAA traffic safety director Jake Nelson said traffic fatalities went up 6 percent in Washington during that same period while the fatalities nationally declined.': '241120225355.txt',\n",

Recently,Jeff Miller, the NFL\\'s senior vice president for player health and safety, and neurological surgeon Russell Lonser, a member of the league\\'s head, neck and spine committee, spoke with researchers Monroe has backed with $80,000 in funding. \"They are interested in learning more about the potential for cannabinoids to help current and former players, as is evidenced by them taking the call, and also expressed a desire to learn more,\" Marcel Bonn-Miller, an adjunct assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania school of medicine, told XXX\\'s Adam Kilgore recently. \"They are definitely showing genuine curiosity, and they are definitely not throwing up roadblocks.\" Marijuana, however, remains on the NFL\\'s list of banned substances. Related: [Monroe funds marijuana research] \"It\\'s an NFL policy and we believe it\\'s the correct policy, for now, in the best interest of our players and the long-term health of our players,\" Commissioner Roger Goodell said a Super Bowl press conference in February. \"I don\\'t foresee a change in that clearly in the short term.\" It may help save the NFL, though. Research has suggested but not yet proved that cannabis may play a role in preventing and treating concussions. Cannabidiol, or CBD, has been shown to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory as well as neuroprotective properties. Animal research indicates CBD could protect neurons and mitigate effects from concussions. Related: [Eugene Monroe released by Ravens] \"We have no guarantee this is going to work,\"Lester Grinspoon, a professor emeritus at Harvard and one of the first medical marijuana researchers, toldKilgore. In fact, he says players should take it before games.\"But if you can take anything away, evidence shows it is neuroprotective. I would have each individual take a capsule an hour or two before they play or practice. It\\'s better than nothing.\" To be clear, Monroe is talking aboutthe use of medical marijuana. \"I\\'m not here advocating for NFL players (or anyone) to get high and party while breaking the law,\" he wrote on The Players\\' Tribune last mont. \"What I\\'m talking about is the responsibility of the NFL to care for its players. Nineteen players were suspended last season for testing positive for \"substances of abuse,\" and for some, their careers may be over. Why? For using something that can actually help people? How can a league so casual about the use of addictive opioids take such a hard line on a drug that might provide a safer alternative?\" Monroe, the first active player to actively campaign for medical marijuana, is now a free agent after his release, which was fueled in part by his injury history and high salary, last week. \"Despite the current uncertainties,\" he tweeted, one thing is for sure: whatever happens in terms of my professional football career, I will never stop pushing for the League to accept medical cannabis as a viable option for pain management. I will do everything I can to ensure the generations of NFL players after me won\\'t have to resort to harmful and addictive opioids as their only option for pain management.\"': '050121172353.txt',\n",
       "             'Doug Fines recent piece, Five myths about legalizing marijuana, which promotes the legalization of the drug, received a lot of attention. In his column, Fine states five common-sensical assertions regarding marijuana use in our country that he wishes werent true, labels them as myths, and presto, concludes that legalizing weed will actually help solve a lot of problems. Oh, really? Call me old-fashioned, but also call me realistic. Advocates of legalizing marijuana are making this debate harder than it has to be. Simply put: What current problems of ours might be solved if we had more inebriated people wandering among us? The first thing pot promoters want us to do is deny the obvious, as if we are all stoned. They want us to believe that the known consequences associated with being on the loose with degraded senses in an open society would simply not occur or at the very least, would not increase if marijuana use were to become more widespread. In Fines case, myth number one is that, If pot is legal, more people will use it. To rebut that statement, Fine cites something or another about drug use in Portugal between the years 2002 and 2006. Im not kidding, this is the best theyve got. I dont know what it is about modern life in Portugal that we should seek to emulate or why Portuguese drug use should serve as a model for drug use in the United States. But, you get my point. Read Fines piece. Anyway, this is an issue where Republicans should be clear and speak with one voice. At a base level, our politics should seek to promote a more sober, safe and virtuous society, and nothing about making pot use more widespread than it already is serves the common interest. I can hear the left rolling their eyes at this quaint notion. We should not think we can appeal to a segment of voters particularly young voters by embracing destructive misbehavior as desirable public policy.': '050121172347.txt',\n",

       "             'The NFL should treat marijuana an issue with equal caution, marijuana industry lobbyist Jim McMahon has said.\\nIn an open letter to the league and the Administration of Justice, McMahon made the assertion that marijuana can cause inflammation, pain, and suffering to an NFL player by the use of the drug.\\nMcMahon contends this week that marijuana doesnt cause any injuries. Its proven to be beneficial in pro athletes in ways that football and baseball dont normally focus on because of its effect on sports. There are widespread conversations about marijuana use and how it is actually impacting collegiate football players.\\nMcMahon represents a different perspective. He is concerned that marijuana problems are more subtle and that the injuries to players are less obvious and recognizable.\\nCigarettes present two different side effects. At the bowl games there are clearly a measurable incidence of post-menopausal disorders such as osteoporosis, McMahon wrote in the letter posted to TheHerald, a Richmond, Va.-based newspaper. In spite of the apparent lack of a devastating effect, there has been a rising rate of the occurrence of suffering from these conditions.\\nHe also concerns the impact the drugs have on ones joints.\\nDealing with an unresponsive joint and a mole area have limited symptoms like headaches and nausea, and it seems that shoulder pain may be resulting in joints not sprouting up, McMahon wrote. These symptoms can result in joints becoming exposed to smoke and artificial compounds that assist in the movement of the joints. Marijuana can play a role in this.\\nThe letter was authored by attorneys Christine Mattison and Michael Greco.\\nMcMahon has written hundreds of letters across the nation before but has not written in opposition to marijuana as a possible treatment for the NFL. His big pharmaceutical client at the time was the NFLs Seattle Seahawks.\\nIn the letter, McMahon says the NFL must consider how this disorder happens: This subject is challenging enough to allow consumers to make educated determinations based on these findings. We are uncertain whether cannabis can successfully treat these symptoms. However, our decision will be made based on the current data that supports safety and effectiveness. This is a viewpoint that many physicians share and we would welcome discussion with patients and the league on this issue.\\nMcMahon has no idea what his potential client would be talking about. In an email message to TheHerald, McMahon didnt immediately return a request for comment.\\nMarijuana is used in many forms of medicine and millions of Americans smoke pot every year.\\nXXX reported earlier this month that marijuana has been responsible for improving symptoms for former NFL quarterback Jim McMahon, who died Sunday at age 65.

       "             'A federal program that has provided free marijuana to the seriously ill is being phased out by Health and Human Services officials who have concluded it undercuts official Bush administration policy against the use of illegal drugs, according to HHS officials. While a small number of patients already receiving marijuana will continue to do so, new applicants will be encouraged to try synthetic forms of delta-9-THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, rather than the weed itself, according to a new policy directive due to be signed by James O. Mason, chief of the Public Health Service. Mason said yesterday he was concerned about a surge in new applications in recent months, especially from AIDS patients, and the message it would send if HHS were to approve them. \"If it\\'s perceived that the Public Health Service is going around giving marijuana to folks, there would be a perception that this stuff can\\'t be so bad,\" said Mason. \"It gives a bad signal. I don\\'t mind doing that if there\\'s no other way of helping these people. . . . But there\\'s not a shred of evidence that smoking marijuana assists a person with AIDS.\" But his decision drew angry criticism from pro-marijuana activists who contended that many AIDS and cancer patients have found the drug invaluable in combating the nausea caused by their treatments. \"This is ludicrous,\" said Kevin Zeese, vice president of the Drug Policy Foundation, a group that has promoted the use of marijuana for medical purposes. \"What they are going to do is deny medicine to very sick Americans for political reasons. . . . This shows the cruelty of the war on drugs.\" Zeese noted that Herbert D. Kleber, deputy national drug control policy director, had touted the program on national television as a \"compassionate\" option that was available to seriously ill patients. But while the new HHS policy has been in the works for more than two months, officials said this week they did not believe the drug control policy office had been consulted. Kleber was out of town yesterday and could not be reached for comment. The new policy is the latest development in a debate about marijuana\\'s classification under the drug laws. The Drug Enforcement Administration has denied that marijuana has any therapeutic value and has classified it as a Schedule I drug, the same as heroin, forbidding doctors to prescribe it. But last April, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ordered the DEA to reconsider its stand after concluding that the agency had acted unreasonably in evaluating the drug\\'s possible effectiveness. In addition, a recent survey by Harvard University researchers found that nearly half of 1,035 cancer specialists who responded reported that they would prescribe marijuana to their patients if it were legal to do so. For the past 15 years, pre-rolled cigarettes of marijuana -- grown at a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) research farm in Oxford, Miss. -- have been provided to a handful of such patients. But officials said applications began to increase markedly following publicity over the case of Kenneth and Barbra Jenks, a Florida couple suffering from AIDS. Convicted of violating the state\\'s drug laws last year, the Jenkses applied and won Food and Drug Administration approval to use the drug as an \"investigative new drug.\" While only six people had received marijuana under the program before last summer, the FDA has received 28 applications in the past year, and was concerned that it would be swamped with hundreds more in coming months, officials said. Pro-marijuana activists \"were beginning to promote this . . . it was becoming a kind of \\'write in and here\\'s how you do it\\' kind of thing,\" said Jeffrey A. Nesbit, an FDA spokesman.': '050121172341.txt',\n",
       "             'Tuesday was a banner night for medical marijuana with ballot initiatives in numerousstates widening access to the substance for Americansseeking relief from pain or a treatment for illness. Massachusetts and California, where Napster co-founder and cancer philanthropist Sean Parker helped fund a campaign to legalize the drug, were among the states passing new recreational marijuana laws. The tide also turned in Florida, North Dakota and Arkansas where similar measures were defeated in the past and in Montana wheremeasures regarding medical marijuana were passed. Before this week, medical marijuana was legal in a little overhalf the country or 25 states. The winscome as rigorous scientific evidence ismounting that marijuana or its componentsmay have beneficial medical effects. Earlier this year,GW Pharmaceuticals said that clinical trials show acannabis-deriveddrug may be able to reduce seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome, a rare and severe form of epilepsy. Physiciansare also increasingly looking to marijuana as an alternative to highly addictiveopioids that have led toa crisis in overdoses. This chart, from my colleague Christopher Ingraham , shows just how dramatic thedifference in the painkiller prescriptions is inmedical-marijuana states vs. non-medical-marijuana states. Here\\'s a closer look at the medical marijuana measures passed Tuesday night: Florida: A similar measure was narrowly defeated two years ago. This time, voters cast their ballots overwhelmingly in favor of a full-scale medical marijuana program. The new amendment states that patients with illnesses of the \"same kind or class as or comparable to\" serious illnesses, such as cancer, HIV, post-traumatic stress disorder, Parkinson\\'s disease and epilepsy would be eligible to access medical marijuana. Some450,000 residents would qualify, according to The News-Press in Fort Myers. The state already had laws on the books that allowed the use of marijuana for the terminally ill and of acannabis-derived drug for epilepsy. North Dakota: According to the Bismark Tribune , \"The measure will allow people to possess up to 3 ounces of medical marijuana for treatment of up to nearly a dozen medical conditions. Facilities for medical marijuana distribution will be licensed by the state Health Department and operated by nonprofit organizations.\" Montana: The Independent Record in Helena reported that the measure means that \"providers of the drug will not be limited to the number of patients they can serve:\" \"The previous restriction imposed a limit of three, which was sharply opposed by patients and providers in the program.Most medical marijuana patients were left without a registered provider under the restrictions. Since they went into effect, patients have left the program. More than a third of patients registered in September left over the next month 7,785 remained in October, according to the state health department. \"I-182 adds post-traumatic stress disorder to the list of eligible conditions, allows for lab testing for marijuana and orders annual health department inspections of providers.\" Arkansas: The measure allows people who have any of18 qualifying conditions such as cancer, glaucoma, Tourette\\'s syndrome, Alzheimer\\'s disease and hepatitis C to access dispensaries. Accordingto the Associated Press and KTHV , \"some political leaders said they preferred that Arkansas legislators instead allow a version of the drug that is low in THC, which gives marijuana its high.\"': '050121172355.txt',\n",
       "             'Most Americans - 2 out of 3 - say marijuana use should be legal, according to new data from Pew Research Center that builds on a decades-long trend line. The share of those opposed, meanwhile, has plunged 20 percentage points, to 32 percent, in the past decade. Legalization is supported by 78 percent of Democrats and 55 percent of Republicans. It has roughly two-thirds support among every racial, gender and educational group in the U.S., according to the survey. The data do show one significant demographic fault line, however: age. Legalization is supported by 63 percent of boomers, 65 percent of Gen Xers, and 76 percent of millennials. But among the silent generation those older than 74 years support is just 35 percent. AD Partisan differences are heavily mediated by age as well. Among the silent generation, for instance, there is a 32-point gap in support between Democrats (53 percent) and Republicans (21 percent). Among millennials, more than 70 percent support legal marijuana, regardless of party affiliation. AD In assessing support for marijuana, surveys have typically posed a simple question : Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal, or should NOT be made legal? For this survey, however, Pew researchers posed a separate question to suss out whether Americans back recreational marijuana, medical marijuana, both or neither. Fifty-nine percent said it should be legal for both medical and recreational purposes, a 10-point increase since fall 2016. Thirty-two percent said it should be legal for medical use only. Just 8 percent said it should not be legal at all, a steep drop from the 15 percent recorded in 2016. AD As with many political issues , the publics preferences on marijuana are well to the left of where the policy currently stands. The plant remains illegal for all purposes under federal law. Recreational marijuana is legal in 11 states plus D.C. , in most cases because of voter-approved ballot initiatives. Most other states have some form of medical marijuana law, although in many cases there are severe restrictions on the conditions for which medical marijuana can be used, or on the types of marijuana that can be used. AD According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , just four states Idaho, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas prohibit marijuana use in all forms. As more and more states have moved forward with their own marijuana liberalization policies in recent years, public support has only grown stronger, Erik Altieri, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said in a statement . At a time when the political divide is larger than ever, the issue of marijuana legalization is one of the few policy issues upon which most Americans agree. AD Legalization foes contend that marijuana use comes with negative health effects. This week, the group Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM) highlighted the results of a study in the journal JAMA Psychiatry showing a half-percentage-point increase in rates of problematic cannabis use among teens in states that have legalized recreational use. AD Legalization efforts are sending the message that marijuana use is safe and state sanctioned, SAM President Kevin Sabet said in a statement . \"No amount of marijuana use is safe for young people and more must be done to halt its normalization. Most of the Democratic presidential candidates support legalizing recreational use in some form or another . But there are notable outliers, among them former vice president Joe Biden, who long supported tough on crime legislation while he was in the U.S. Senate. He opposes legalization but has signaled a preference to reduce criminal penalties for pot use. Billionaire Democratic hopeful Mike Bloomberg recently called marijuana legalization the stupidest thing anyone has ever done. President Trump, meanwhile, has had little to say about marijuana one way or another during his time in office, though he did recently reiterate support for letting states decide their own policies.': '050121172357.txt',\n",

But Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley suggested something a little less dramatic.\\nThe governor said recently that his administration would consider supporting an effort by the state to court legalization proponents, especially teenagers, who have been exempt from a three-judge appeals court decision against an equal-protection provision of the Criminal Justice Act that bars them from seeking employment or disability benefits in the wake of the Supreme Courts Citizens United decision.\\nBut Maryland Republicans had decided to delay the measure to become law rather than succumb to a presidential veto by then-Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.\\nThe concern isnt that OMalley should resort to that tactic but that a quieter alliance between the House and Senate over where marijuana is to be legalized, as the state has done, is being exploited to avoid taking on that battle in the future. So one good reason not to take on that dirty trick: Even if it means letting some legalization debate die, with only a tiny portion of the counties poised to get it, the chances that such an initiative would succeed are slim.\\nCalifornia saw a similarly slow uptake in helping it devise a plan to legalize recreational marijuana use. One state consultant called Proposition 64 one of the most important ballot measures of the last five years and said [Californians] are not certain that this is gonna be successful. Nor is it sure that even in California, where legal and mandated pot use can be legal for adults, voters will be convinced that its a win for the rights of those who own marijuana.\\nInstead, its hard to see that in Maryland, and we see it again this summer, legislators will be able to exclude those who have already left, cant afford to kick cocaine off their drug cards or whove done work studies and graduated from college. Or are they doing all they can to undercut the convictions of those who want to make it their business to seek treatment rather than selling the product out to unscrupulous salesmen.\\nThat leaves the lawmakers with two options: Protecting those stuck in the muck and continuing to try and unapologetically try to legitimize the exercise of the power of marijuana. That is, there should be no veto. Either side cant produce a good show in the House. Instead, it must mean blocking tougher measures like the one posed by California, while imposing some sort of fair-weatherscaping fee on voters of all political stripes. It will strike voters like the Democratic Campaign Committee wanted to avoid the deer in the headlights high tax appeal.\\nDemocrats have been in every house in the state since the 2006 election, and the six not-so-likely-to-be-In-Md-ard from Maryland are coming along:\\nMyHope for a Calm Debates: Theyre almost certainly in better shape than the five Marylanders on the ballot this fall.

With medical marijuana shops on nearly every corner and a libertarian-leaning electorate not to mention its status as a swing state the Centennial State could tempt Romney to take a seemingly radical turn on drugs. Pot legalizers note that he could couch his support in terms of a 10th amendment argument essentially saying it should simply be up to states to decide for themselves. That would allow him to maintain his own opposition to legalization while also giving a shout-out to social conservatives, who love a good nod to states rights.

       "             \"at 1:41 PM An assortment of marijuana strains are seen Nov. 11,during the High Times Harvest Cup in San Bernardino, Calif. (Richard Vogel/AP) Alcoholic beverage sales fell by 15 percent following the introduction of medical marijuana laws in a number of states, according to a new working paper by researchers at the University of Connecticut and Georgia State University. The study adds to a growing body of evidence showing that marijuana availability can reduce alcohol consumption. Because experts generally agree that, on balance, alcohol use is more harmful to individuals and society than marijuana use , thiswould represent a significant public health benefit of marijuana legalization. For the study, researchers examined alcohol sales data included in Nielsen's Retail Scanner database , which includes product-level sales data from 90 retail chains across the United States.The researchers say this represents an improvement over other ways of measuring alcohol consumption survey respondents, for instance, are known to severely lowball their alcohol consumption when asked about it by interviewers. The researchers compared alcohol sales between states that implemented medical marijuana laws and those that didn't, before and after the change in marijuana laws. They also corrected for a number of economic and demographic variables known to affect alcohol use, such as age, race and income. We find that marijuana and alcohol are strong substitutes for each other, the study concludes. Counties located in[medical marijuana] states reduced monthly alcohol sales by 15 percent after the introduction of medical marijuana laws. If these findings are correct, it's likely that they understate the effect of full marijuana legalization on alcohol use. Under medical marijuana laws, only a small handful of people are legally able to access the drug patientswishing to use it must typically obtain a recommendation from a doctor, and in most states only certain conditions are eligible for treatment with marijuana. Full recreational legalization, as is the case now in Colorado and seven other states, means that any individual can purchase pot on demand. While not all of the existing research agrees that marijuana availability decreases alcohol use, a solid body ofevidence points to that conclusion. An analysis last year of 39 reports on the subject found that 16 supported the idea that people substitute marijuanause for alcohol, while 10 studies suggested that marijuana availability actually increased alcohol use. Twelve additional studies supported neither conclusion. Unlike alcohol, marijuana has no known fatal dose people don't die of marijuana poisoning. Relative to marijuana, alcohol is more addictive , far more likely to cause vehicle accidents , and much more closely linked to violent and aggressive behavior . In the United States, excessive alcohol use kills nearly 90,000 people each year, according to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.\": '091120113030.txt',\n",
       "             'Domestic marijuana growers are harvesting a record $8.2 billion crop of homegrown pot this year, the National Association for the Reform of Marijuana Laws has estimated. The 1981 marijuana crop is twice as big as last year\\'s, making the illegal herb the nation\\'s fourth most valuable farm product, after corn, soybeans and wheat, the pro-pot lobbying group claimed. A spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration called the $8 billion figure \"far-fetched\" but said federal authorities recognize domestic marijuana production is increasing. DEA estimated the 1979 U.S. pot crop was worth $1 billion to $1.5 billion and supplied about 10 percent of the marijuana smoked in America that year. \"We have no numbers for the 198l crop yet,\" said DEA press officer David Hoover. \"But based on the tonnage and the total market, I don\\'t see how the domestic marijuana market could be $8.2 billion.\" George Farnham, political director for NORML, said the organization\\'s estimates are based on law enforcement statistics, newspaper accounts and figures supplied by growers. Like law enforcement authorities, NORML values marijuana based on the price it would bring if sold in small quantities, Farnham said. Depending on quality, homegrown pot sells for $10 to $150 an ounce, he added. Much of the marijuana grown in the United States is smoked by the grower or friends rather than sold, so sales of domestic marijuana are smaller than the $8 billion crop value indicated, he conceded. NORML estimates between 1 million and 2 million Americans grew pot for personal use this year, but only one-tenth that many grew it commercially. Though several states have removed criminal penalties for possession of small quantities of marijuana, growing pot is illegal in every state except Alaska, which permits cultivation for personal consumption. The total number of marijuana arrests last year was about the same as the year before--342,000--but arrests for cultivation and sale jumped more than 25 percent, from 49,700 to 63,300, according to the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse. Marijuana cultivation has spread all over the country from Hawaii and California, and 29 states produced crops worth more than $100 million this year, Farnham claimed. With a crop valued at more than $1.5 billion, California is the leading marijuana producer, NORML says, followed by Hawaii at $750 million and Oregon at $400 million. NORML estimates Virginia grew $200 million worth of marijuana this year and Maryland produced another $100 million worth. Virginia Beach police arrested 180 people one day last August for growing pot around apartment complexes, NORML noted, and Scott County authorities found a field with an estimated 15,000 marijuana plants. Farnham said the growth of domestic pot production has been encouraged by the Reagan administration\\'s decision to cut the budget of DEA and curtail federal aid to local law enforcement authorities. The administration recommended cutting the DEA budget 12 percent, from $228.5 million to $201 million for fiscal 1982. The House and Senate versions of the DEA budget call for appropriations of about $231 million. NORML officials say the government\\'s decision to spray the herbicide paraquat on Mexican marijuana fields led to widespread cultivation of marijuana in the United States. Rather than risk paraquat poisoning, potsmokers decided to grow their own, Farnham explained. Homegrown marijuana was once regarded as inferior to that grown in Mexico, Colombia or Jamaica, but that\\'s no longer the case. Native American marijuana is a plant variety called cannabis sativa, the same hemp plant cultivated since colonial times for the fibers used to make rope. Now growers are cultivating cannabis indica, a Far Eastern variety that is richer in the intoxicating chemical tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). While cannabis sativa is a skinny plant that can grow 15 feet tall, the more potent indica strain grows like a bushy Christmas tree and can yield as much as two pounds of dried and ready-to-smoke marijuana. To make the smoke more potent, Farnham explained, growers have learned to weed out the male marijuana plants and cultivate a sterile, seedless female plant known as sinsemilla, the Spanish word for seedless. Unable to reproduce, the frustrated female plants pour all their energy into producing THC resin. It is this high-powered homegrown pot that sells for up to $150 an ounce, inflating the value of the domestic crop, NORML officials say. The organization says wild animals and poachers are greater threats to marijuana patches than are law enforcement authorities. To avoid being caught with the crop in their yard, growers have taken to planting their patches on public land. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported earlier this year it has found marijuana being cultivated in most of the national forests.': '091120113042.txt',\n",
       "             'at 1:00 AM A military officer and a horticultural expert tend cannabis plants under cultivation by the Italian army at the Stabilimento Chimico Farmaceutico Militare (Military Chemical Pharmaceutical Plant) in Florence in May. (Laura Lezza/Getty Images) MILAN In Italy, as in most of western Europe, medical cannabis is legal. What sets the country apart is that cultivation of the plant is a de facto army monopoly. The only place cannabis can be legally grown here is at a heavily guarded military facility in Florence where, this year, two greenhouses produced a yield of about 220 pounds. \"We do everything in-house,\" said the facility\\'s director, Col. Antonio Medica. \"We grow the plants, harvest them, dry and grind the leaves, sanitize the final product with gamma rays, then ship it to pharmacies and hospitals.\" Now the army\\'s involvement in the therapeutic marijuana business is set to expand. Under a new budget law moving through Parliament, the cannabis program at the Military Chemical Pharmaceutical Plant is to receive an additional $2 billion in public funding. If the bill is approved as anticipated, military officials say, they expect production to triple within a year. The bill will also make medical cannabis free for all patients, with the cost covered by the government. Until now, local governments have covered the cost in just 11 of Italy\\'s 21 provinces. Not everyone is happy with the army\\'s role, however. Some say they believe that even with the new funding, the quantity and the quality of Italian-grown cannabis will fall short. Related: [The millennial who could be Italys next leader] To understand how the army ended up growing pot, one has to understand the country\\'s health policy and the way its implementation has, at times, been delegated to the military. Italy legalized cannabis for medical use in 2007, with many caveats. To grow the plant legally requires special authorization from the Health Ministry\\'s narcotics office, which means dealing with the country\\'s infamous bureaucracy. As a result, no private entrepreneur managed to set up a business, and the drug had to be imported from abroad, making it prohibitively expensive. Ten new greenhouses for cannabis cultivation, pictured above in May, are to be added to the two currently used at the armys Florence facility. The plant hopes to triple its production of medical cannabis to meet the demand of Italian patients and to end the need to import from abroad. (Laura Lezza/Getty Images) Since access to medical care here is considered a constitutional right, in 2014 the government assigned the task of growing medical-grade cannabis to the military. The army was already responsible for the production of \"orphan drugs,\" medications that cure rare diseases and are not produced in the market economy. \"Producing medicines is a standard part of what the Defense Industries Agency does, because health is a matter of national security,\" Medica said. Problems with the decision soon became apparent, according to critics. One difficulty is that the army makes only one strain of cannabis, called FM2, which is low in THC, one of marijuana\\'s main active substances, when compared to imported strains. Andrea Trisciuglio, a 39-year-old multiple sclerosis patient from Foggia in southern Italy, said he has been using medical marijuana for the past 10 years to mitigate his symptoms but has found the local supply ineffective. \"The FM2 just doesn\\'t work for patients like me,\" he said. \"I have to use Bedrocan\" a variety of cannabis with about 22 percent THC, compared to FM2\\'s 8 percent. Trisciuglio said that his local hospital imports Bedrocan from the Netherlands but that he sometimes he has to wait as long as a month for it. The trouble with importing cannabis from the Netherlands is that it \"is expensive, which also makes it slow,\" said Carlo Valente, a lawyer in the southern city of Lecce who is representing Trisciuglio and other patients. Dutch medicines, he said, reach Italy through intermediary agencies, which raises their price. \"This is making doctors, who already struggle with the social taboo associated with cannabis, even more reluctant to prescribe it and hospital pharmacies less cooperative,\" he said. According to an investigation by the magazine Internazionale, imported cannabis can cost up to $84 a gram. By contrast, the army-produced cannabis costs $7 a gram, Medica said. \"We are a nonprofit.\" The medical-grade cannabis produced by the Italian army is the strain known as FM2, which some patients say is not as effective as imported varieties. (Laura Lezza/Getty Images) But to critics of the system, affordability does not cancel out the homegrown product\\'s other shortcomings. In addition to quality issues, they say, the army lacks the capability to produce all the therapeutic cannabis that Italy needs. National consumption of the drug is between 880 and 1,000 pounds a year, according to military estimates. This means that even if the military succeeds in tripling its annual production to the anticipated 660 pounds, it will not meet the country\\'s need, and imports from the Netherlands will still be necessary. To Trisciuglio, the army monopoly is not in patients\\' best interest. \"The army alone is just not enough,\" he said. \"We need to make it easier for others to grow medical cannabis.\" In 2012, Trisciuglio and other patients petitioned the local government for authorization to grow their own marijuana, under supervision, but never received a green light. Medica, however, is confident that the army can meet and keep up with the demand, perhaps even to the point of sending its own cannabis abroad. \"We are working around the clock to increase the production and are experimenting with a new variant, for patients who are not satisfied with FM2,\" he said. \"In the near future, we hope to export to San Marino and the Vatican.\"': '091120113040.txt',\n",
       "             'Lady Gaga has revealed details of her marijuana addiction , explaining that at one point, she was smoking 15 to 20 marijuana cigarettes a day, according to news reports. \"I have been addicted to it and it\\'s ultimately related to anxiety coping and it\\'s a form of self-medication,\" Gaga said on the Z100 Morning Show, as reported by People magazine. Gaga broke her hip earlier this year, causing her to cancel part of her Born This Way tour . \"I was living on a totally other psychedelic plane, numbing myself completely, and looking back I do see now that some of it had to do with my hip pain ,\" she told Z100, as reported by People. \"I didn\\'t know where the pain was coming from so I was just in a lot of pain and very depressed all the time and not really sure why.\" While research has shown that the percentage of people who try marijuana and become addicted to it is small, it is possible to get hooked on the drug. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, about 9 percent of marijuana users become dependent on the drug , with that percentage going up for people who begin using the drug in adolescence. Comparatively, Scientific American pointed out that in a 1994 study showing that 9 percent of people who\\'ve tried marijuana become dependent on it , the numbers are higher for other substances: alcohol is 15 percent, heroin is 23 percent and nicotine is 32 percent. Marijuana withdrawal (officially called cannabis withdrawal in the recently released fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) is also sometimes seen in people who stop using marijuana , and is characterized by anxiety, problems sleeping, irritability and aggression, the NIDA reported. And while it\\'s impossible to die from a marijuana overdose like you would from other illicit, dangerous drugs, dependence on marijuana can cause disruptions to people\\'s lives, TIME reported. However, TIME pointed out that addiction to marijuana does not look exactly the same as addiction to other illicit drugs , such as heroin. TIME explains: In this view, the paradigm for addiction is heroin: the shaking, puking heroin junkie who cant quit because the withdrawal sickness is impossible to bear. Because marijuana cessation is not linked with such severe symptoms, the drug isnt seen as physically addictive. And considering that most people view physical addiction as uncontrollable, but psychological addiction as manageable with proper willpower, marijuana tends not to be regarded as addictive in general.': '170321174919.txt',\n",

       "             'This week, the Libertarian Ethics Commission released some findings on the issue. As Buzzfeed reported:\\nJust a few months ago I was talking about people often abusing marijuana and thinking that in 20 years we\\'ll have people really getting into first-degree criminal possession of a weapon and — for that reason — think we should ban weed and weed for young people, so as not to hurt anyone. I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s the only explanation. I\\'m not quite sure that is the reason — just that everyone has such odd powers and it comes from the academy, which is scary to an extent. And there\\'s a bunch of ideas on how this might happen, and there are just a lot of stupid ideas here that nobody has even tried to think about.\\nThere are some interesting examples that seem to demonstrate the same alarming fact: just like in the first bunch of drugs I mentioned, people believe marijuana is fine to use, while in that third generation and after, cannabis takes away a lot of all that is good.\\nSo this study is no doubt about the bottom line for marijuana use, although it\\'s also about helping young people develop their cognitive skills. I think it\\'s great that libertarians like James Hansen found similar findings, but that\\'s because libertarians have a grandstanding set of figures in their heads saying marijuana is a good thing, that it\\'s good to use, there\\'s no logic behind it. At the same time it\\'s amazing that libertarianism, which follows a simple approach to science to avoid radical change, a structure to avoid, that has ideas and a different way of thinking, now has a problem to worry about.\\nAnother statement in the study is that marijuana is not only not a bad thing, but it is incredibly harmful to our brain. It\\'s a great drug, if it should be allowed to remain there; it\\'s been a massive part of our lives since the end of time and just showed up that every Tuesday and Thursday, every month at least, you don\\'t have to worry about it.

       "             'I always recall how toxic a lot of chatter seemed at the time. This is probably one of those stories where I wanted to express that I don\\'t feel very enthusiastic about this? I was confused by the idea that drug dealers would finance most of the drug supply for themselves – and I don\\'t really see why someone could not profit from that.\\nBut why would anyone believe that war is the problem? Imagine what the other pot mess would look like if it were years before prohibition was legal. Instead of fearing for the others, do we feel inclined to sustain a wider debate about the pros and cons of marijuana?\\nThat really is so interesting. We seem to have made an argument with more nuance than the expert arguments, with minor tweaks that detract from the truth and with realistic observational stories built around the facts of what\\'s being said. Of course this whole extra-legalisation thing is keeping people away from marijuana. But then no matter how you get round that sentiment, that argument must end and everyone feels equally unsettled by whatever the problem is. That also explains why the author of this essay, Professor Chris Crennan, argued that no legitimate questions have to be asked on whether the illegal drugs used in the US are primarily used to manufacture cannabis. The argument is fine to you, that we need to find something to please our disapproving constituents – to make them dosh with it. But the argument is really just a mechanism to make things pop. It\\'s like the Earth\\'s going to snap into alignment, so I\\'ll allow you to call that a \"goggle\".\\nSo the argument might be that this is a fine argument to start making, that everything is now mainly just about politics, that marijuana is most of the product: it\\'s fundamentally a not-for-profit industry that\\'s meant to give society great wealth, but which, when you add in the mass marketing effect of more than 60 different kinds of illegitimate drug-product – including, of course, the stuff you don\\'t know anything about – it\\'s all about money. Again, we can\\'t really resolve this because all that we can do is just pretend that, while we may think we know everything about marijuana, it really isn\\'t. So the problem with the “mythology” of course lies with the other half of it. Because we think we know a lot about cannabis, and don\\'t realise much about the medical side that is equally true, how we can leave such a large part of it to us to allow others to exploit it as their own private fiefdom.\\nAnd I\\'ve got a pointed question to ask yourself if you\\'ll question that – is it completely true that the whole drug industry is okay to move vast amounts of it on to the drug market? Yes. The reality is that any drug company who needs marijuana for an entire pot business, and whose people should know what the costs are and what is a valid recovery mechanism for recovering it, will only be exposed to a price increase that they don\\'t actually know. So my question is why is there such a major backlash against the industry and why isn\\'t it what it is now, people of, like, a possible conspiracy against the sovereignty of the common people? Wouldn\\'t that have allowed them to convince everyone else that, believe it or not, there\\'s something to the conspiracy theory?\\nSo what\\'s the cure for all this bullshit?

The flasks were found in the summer of 2002 and were left on Simpson Timber Company land above the Ohpah Creek Ranch. It now turns out the flasks were part of what is known as a \"meth dump.\" That is where the unused residue and cooking utensils from labs are discarded. A Humboldt County Sheriff\\'s Department official used a recent dumpsite at Colusa, to explain, \"Mexican nationals had dumped their old chemicals and supplies into an irrigation canal.\" Two persons interviewed claimed there are five meth labs between Weitchpec and the river mouth. One of the labs is known to both civilian and law enforcement as the \"Crystal Palace.\" When asked, one Siskiyou County law enforcement official said, \"If the truth were know, there are probably 50 labs.\" ... The entire 41 miles of river between Weitchpec and the river mouth has no roads and is completely isolated from any civilization. There are dozens of documented cases of Mexican and Asian drug cartels using remote areas to both grow marijuana, and manufacture meth. These cases include the Klamath River area.

The court unanimously overruled an appellate court decision in the case People v Roger Mentch\", writing: \" We hold that a defendant whose caregiving consisted principally of supplying marijuana and instructing on its use, and who otherwise only sporadically took some patients to medical appointments, cannot qualify as a primary caregiver under the Act and was not entitled to an instruction on the primary caregiver affirmative defense.

       "             'More than a century ago, I wrote an article about California\\'s constitutional obligation to fight the drug epidemic, in which my writing partner asked, \"Is it really a country\\'s responsibility to protect its population from the cancer of pot?\" The answer was not. Let me explain.\\nGiven the repeated reminders from government doctors, hospitals and their civil liberties activists in California that a majority of us still believe that most illegal drug is \"good,\" as On the Line and Two Studies put it, \"Our living standards are deteriorating for people with very high-quality drugs,\" the efficacy of the plagues-infested public square has long been doubted. The populace has still failed to comprehend the true medical benefits of such psychoactive drug abuse. But, as members of the California State Assembly put it last November, \"It is not legitimate for officials who are in the public square to hold themselves accountable for drug abuse. It is not their responsibility, which puts them above the law.\"\\nUnder its law, the CCC looks after such matters. But Forcing law enforcement to confiscate and use drugs against local residents is exactly the kind of way the federal government and courts have barred local marijuana arrests and that federal government has retaliated by preventing local governments from conducting drug monitoring programs that enforce federal law. In \"Raid on Robberies,\" a small Colorado town made a lot less attractive to police by raiding a nearby marijuana grow operation, the Journal of State Law and Policy reported that the Denver Police Department had actually been investigating successful robberies in the town\\'s neighborhoods, saying, \"We were as vigilant as we could be and we didn\\'t turn up any crack.\" The suggestion that a local government might be unwilling to protect the people of America from drug-impaired behavior at the expense of local law enforcement is deflected by the allegation that federal officials were dragging their feet on drug monitoring in some smaller cities that have since resolved their civil liberties issues with allowing local police to monitor residents\\' traffic, home crimes and other activities.\\nA prohibition on marijuana in America makes no sense in light of the American very public-private partnership in drugs, prison and background checks for new marijuana sellers, which involve public dollars, to be directed from a joint of cities and states. And with little regard for the accountability of local policymakers, local governments should demand more accountability. The solution to the problem of Oregon and Washington\\'s marijuana legalization efforts, devised by our movement movement movement, is to focus a bit more on the province of individual states and to think about the proper response to legalization and the issue of marijuana in general. Three hundred sixty-seven of our movement members from five states proposed a resolution to federal courts last year declaring that local governments can still coerce local governments to monitor their residents\\' drug use:\\n\"To ensure federal law enforcement conducts its full, mandatory surveillance of the legalization of marijuana, that local governments not knowingly engage in government-sanctioned drug monitoring, states must establish a clear and pervasive obligation to prohibit citizens from selling any material marijuana with intent to endanger, purchase, possession, or deliver it on any controlled substance, and address such criminal activity if necessary.\"\\nThese are lofty undertakings. Though marijuana was present in Colorado, it was far less popular for the plebiscite. As a result, combined federal and state efforts were stalled, while local political squabbles deepened in California over whether, in November 2006, to overturn Measure T -- the city-federal initiative that decriminalized marijuana possession for small but intimate use -- got its second reading by a larger margin, leaving just 31% to 38%. As politicians wrestled over just how many voters in the two California cities would support the proposition, a protest by a grass-roots group started out collecting signatures and later broadened to reaching out to local officials. That group then received 75,000 signatures, demanding a written law that recognized marijuana by the statutory definition. In a similar vein, Measure T also established what was described as a state-sanctioned \"drug abuse assessment\" review program that worked \"effectively after the initial raid on an expanded operation that resulted in the prohibition of certain types of marijuana.\" The backers of the proposal included former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (now out of office), health officials, and state Supreme Court Justice Mon': '291220224330.txt',\n",

Forty-two percent of those polled indicated they were less likely to vote for such a change compared to just 19 percent among Democrats and 11 percent among independents.\\nThe poll comes after the United States Senate narrowly approved the legalization bill last month. However, Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Democrat who chairs the senate Judiciary Committee, warned that the measure would have a serious impact on civil liberties and passed. The need for current laws was striking to me.\\nThe United States government has created more than just a legal cannabis industry, because marijuana laws are already being enforced in 35 states, including Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska.

Pursuing, and running through, such smugglers and combatants is an intricate role of the United States criminal justice system. The United States criminal justice system does not require a conviction for marijuana possession. Arresting and criminalizing marijuana would not be a political decision or a politically correct decision.

       "             'Colorado medical marijuana shops are expecting a very festive atmosphere at 8 AM tomorrow, when they will be able to open their doors to anyone willing to buy the drug. The state has predicted that 2014 will see a $571.1 million profit on legal marijuana sales in 2014, all of it taxed. A Bloomberg report on the eve that marijuana legalization takes effect in Colorado notes that the state also expects $67 million in tax revenue alone from those nearly $600 million in profits. The profits will go in part to funding schools, and only those over the age of 21 can buy marijuana at legally licensed stores. The stores opening tomorrow morning were already in existence, selling their product medically to those with a prescription. No new shops may legally open until July. Shop owners are reporting long lines of people already camping out in front of their stores. One shop owner told Bloomberg she was preparing by buying heaters and bringing over a food truck to help those camping out. Others report the lines are expected later tonight. These reports are in stark contrast to predictions from earlier this month; the AP previously cited experts from the Medical Marijuana Council saying this December that Colorado was not going to be Wal-Mart on Black Friday and many users might be disappointed. The cause for concern at the time was that many of the eligible dispensaries had yet to receive their licenses, and there was a palpable worry that they may not file the paperwork in time for a January 1 opening. By the time the red tape cleared and shops all around the state received their licenses, the tone of reporting shifted to a concern that the demand for the drug would not be met by the few shops opening. The long lines seem to indicate that this, rather than dispensaries not functioning at all, is the problem people will most likely face tomorrow. As the doors open to legalized marijuana in Colorado, the two-tiered legality of the drug raises serious concerns for how the market will run. As marijuana is still illegal on a federal level, the Department of Justice reserves the right to arrest and prosecute people for selling or possessing it. Since marijuana continues to be illegal federally, it also makes the market a fully cash one, as banks cannot aid in the distribution of illegal products. While President Obama has said he has no interest in using the long arm of the law to arrest those who possess the drug in legal states, his record on marijuana arrests is striking in its forcefulness. The President also reserves the right to change his mind.': '050121173515.txt',\n",
       "             'It was a little after midnight when I crossed over the bridge from Laredo, Texas into the sister city of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. After having my car searched I was cleared through the Mexican Customs\\' check point where the military was staged and drove towards my destination. I had a source of mine, a local reporter, call me four hours earlier to tell me to meet him at a specific restaurant at 1 a.m. because he had some photographs and information I was looking for pertaining to a specific series of brutal murders that had taken place in the Laredo corridor. This wasn\\'t all th at unusual-most of the investigative journalists in Mexico work under intense circumstances given that they often come into information relating to the drug cartels that they either can not, or will not, report on because it would be a death sentence for them, so they give the information to someone like me who will get it aired or published in way that does not connect them. I arrived early to the restaurant and since the weather was so pleasant, I decided to take a seat on the patio and have a glass of tea. I sat there for a few minutes when my source arrived and sat down, ordered a drink and handed me a large white envelope. He told me this was everything I had been asking his editor about the day before and that I should be careful how I use them. I thanked him, (by paying him) and we talked for about twenty more minutes and he asked if I could give him a ride home. He got into my rent car and told me to drive towards his house on the outskirts of town-as we drove past the airport and headed towards Monterrey, and just as I was about to make the turn off the highway to drop him near his home, we saw three sets of headlights about two hundred yards off the main road in a desolate section of land. I stopped the car and told him I wanted to see what was going on. Without objection from my friend I drove within a few yards of what appeared to be about a half dozen local cops attempting to seal off a crime scene. We exited our vehicle and walked towards the area where the police cars were shining their lights and as I looked down I was standing over three bodies that, appeared to be young boys judging by their clothes, and who were obviously dead. I stepped over to the side a few steps and there were three more lying in the bushes. As the police started talking to my reporter friend I leaned over the first three bodies and even though I\\'m no forensic expert, I could clearly see they had all been shot execution style in the back of the head. My friend confirmed the other three had the same type wounds. Within a few hours we were able to piece together some of the basic common threads between these young corpses. They were all teenage boys-the oldest was seventeen, the youngest was thirteen. They had all been working for one of the cartels as couriers and pocketed the money after crossing about a hundred pounds of marijuana (about $2000 worth) into the United States. They had they had been caught by their handlers (the men in charge of supervising the young gang members) and since the cartel uses hundreds of kids just like these all over Mexico and the U.S., someone made the decision to make examples of these kids. A message needed to be sent out so the rest of the young recruits would realize the severity of side dealing and not following orders. Six .40 caliber bullets to the heads of these boys sent out a very powerful message. It was a gruesome sight and it made me realize for the first time, that these kids probably never fully understood the \"consequences\" of getting involved with the cartel and dealing a little harmless weed. For years I\\'ve heard people from all over the country, many of them celebrities, politicians and businessmen make the argument that pot is harmless and that it is \"just pot\" - it\\'s not like hard drugs and doesn\\'t carry the same \"consequences\" as cocaine and heroin. Let me just respond like this. To the men that manufacture, transport and sell these narcotics, they are all the same thing-money, and no matter what the substance is, it is intended to be converted into money and that is entirely what this is all about for them. This is just but one example of how they will kill a thirteen year old over a load of pot just as fast as they will kill a thirty year old over a load of cocaine, heroin, or meth. The discussion about the legalization or decriminalization of certain narcotics is starting to pick up traction in our country today and I for one, embrace that discussion. That doesn\\'t mean I embrace the legalization, but I definitely think its time to have a detailed, mature discussion on the matter. But the discussion is meaningless unless we deal with the truth and the truth is, the illicit narcotics trade is not only more profitable than ever before in the history of smuggling, but more deadly than before too. The drug policy in America has become almost schizophrenic especially as it relates to marijuana. No doubt we have to have some type comprehensive reform as it relates to the way we are prosecuting the \"war on drugs\" (dare I even say \"war on drugs?\") because what we have been doing has not worked very well by any standard. Maybe legalization is part of that solution, but this problem is far more complex than any ONE solution. Just like the fence that was built to secure our border and hasn\\'t. What the fence did succeed in doing is curbing one problem in certain areas, but creating more problems in other areas. Neither will the legalization of narcotics fix everything wrong with the drug war. It will curb some things, but be advised it will also create new problems in areas we are not prepared for today, causing a whole new set of consequences. Unlike those teenage boys lying in the desert-we should take the time to understand and fully comprehend those consequences before we endeavor to take that next step.': '050121173507.txt',\n",
       "             \"Kelloggs Corn Pops may be going out of business, but Captain Zig-Zag is about to get an up-tick in popularity if political odd couple Ron Paul (R-TX) and Barney Frank (D-MA) have their way. In a bipartisan effort to end the federal ban on marijuana, a newfangled congressional edition of the doobie brothers are banding together to put forward legislation that limits the federal governments role in policing pot. Ron Paul and Barney Frank are proposing the first bill ever that, if enacted into law, would end centralized marijuana prohibition. The legislation seeks to limit federal involvement in cannabis monitoring to cross-border or inter-state smuggling. If the proposal succeeds, marijuana farmers across America stand to save on electricity and light bulbs as recreational horticulturists venture outside to legally grow weed and even sell the fruit of their harvest in states where pot is legal. Ron Paul, individual liberty and freedom Republican/Libertarian and one half of the bills sponsor, said the following: Drugs are very dangerous but there are a lot of things that are very dangerous. The question is, should we regulate danger? Should we take responsibility for ourselves or should the government take care of us? I dont believe in the nanny state. Paul consistently maintains that the government has no business butting into private lives, so it stands to reason that the same philosophy would apply to bong usage, whether its Ron Pauls, if he has one, or someone elses. One would expect Congressman Paul to step forward on behalf of legalizing marijuana if the end result limits government and grants individual autonomy to be either as reckless or responsible as one desires. On the other hand, Barney Frank may have other, more personal reasons for proposing the legislation. Seems Congressman Frank found himself embroiled in marijuana-related controversy when visiting longtime partner and Fire Island ferry companion James Ready at his home in Maine a few years back. James Ready is also renowned for being spotted on video heckling and calling Sean Bielat, Barneys 2010 opponent for his congressional seat, dude. James is an avid gardener, and when Barney had stopped by Ogunquit for a visit, Mr. Ready was arrested for cultivation and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, which explains James public use of the word dude. Although Frank was on the premises during the arrest, the Massachusetts congressman claimed he knew nothing and told police he didnt live in the house and that he only smoked cigars. Unlike James, who spends a lot of time kicking around out back in the pea patch, Congressman Frank said he was surprised and disappointed with what police found, and that he wouldnt recognize a marijuana plant if he saw one because he is not a great outdoorsman, and wouldnt recognize most plants.' Three years later, Barneys original surprise and disappointment turned into activism because the cigar-smoking congressman, when referring to the Frank/Paul Pot Bill, said that The notion that you lock people up for smoking marijuana is pretty silly. Im going to call it the Make Room for Serious Criminals bill. Never deviating from the libertarian platform whether its legalizing pot or maintaining a foreign policy position of non-intervention, Ron Paul is predictable and, although viewed as eccentric at times, remains pretty much controversy-free. Then theres Barney Frank, who has a scandal-ridden past that includes a history with gay prostitutes and associations with pot-growing and weed-toking male friends, as well as making verbal reassurances that have been proved economically devastating such as: Fannie Mae and Freddie Macare not facing any kind of financial crisis. Although Barney Frank claims to be particularly irked by DEA raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana patients and providers in California, proposing legislation could be what remedies Barneys history of public humiliation. All Barney needs to do is find a congressional colleague wholl sign on to enact laws that take the sting out of embarrassing situations. For example, legalize growing and smoking pot, and in the future Frank can visit James Ready in Maine without the fear of being caught up in a drug raid. For years, Ron Paul has spoken out on behalf of legalizing prostitution; maybe the duo can get a Barney and Ron Bunny Ranch Bill going, which means that when Frank hires con men to run errands it wont matter if personal aides work part-time from home. And with the pesky issue of discounted ferry tickets, maybe the congressman can push through a bill that exempts public employees from paying full price on ferry rides to islands that serve underrepresented minority groups. As for the Freddie and Fannie fiasco, its a little late for legislation to gloss over that debacle. However, for future reference maybe after Barney and Rons cannabis connection helps the two men cultivate a closer relationship, Barney will check with Ron before reassuring the public that government involvement in the housing market is a good thing, especially if you happen to be head of the House Committee on Financial Services at the time. Nevertheless, Ron Paul and Barney Frank are banding together as brothers to smooth relations between state law and a confused federal government that intermittently deploys DEA agents to raid dispensaries in jurisdictions that allow the sale of medical marijuana. As they do, it is nice to know that legalizing pot will also help bring Barney Frank, despite past indiscretions, one step closer to legitimacy.\": '050121173511.txt',\n",

       "             'As the IRS gets ready to release two identical cases that contain an even more vicious name in short order: the Fourth Amendment (nine years after the Supreme Court ruled that the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right), and the ACLU is warning congressional Republicans that it may take two of them to strip the First Amendment from the Capitol Hill press. For a complete list of the Supreme Courts most notorious cases, see this post.\\nIt appears that the nations newest constitutional legal executive order marks the culmination of a conference that began in early June, when the President of the U.S. filed his Freedom of Information Act request for 53-1011 records from the Justice Departments Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Justice Departments Domestic Terrorism Center, the FBIs Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Judicial Nominating Commission, and the Department of Justices Office of Media Access, Privacy and Enforcement. The dispute with the Justice Department, the ACLU and the Supreme Court covers a broad range of topics  from campaign finance violations, surveillance to surveillance techniques, to the present administrations complete immigration enforcement efforts. And the pro-business, pro-securitization movement could be on its way to another major battle over the constitutional rights of taxpayers in 2009, as Congress renews tax cuts to corporations. (See the chart on Offense: Freedom of Information Act at todays Washington Post.)\\nThese are the topics that the Senate Judiciary Committee must address to prevent this Civil War and the public from reading too much into the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled last month that oral arguments in that case were not a sufficient forum for an attempt to have the Supreme Court authorize a U.S. House of Representatives investigation of whether the former Speaker of the House had violated the Constitution by breaking a law. That case, brought to the attention of the Government Accountability Office, continued to descend on an off-the-record setting, as it did in the Merrick Garland case. But in recent years, the Supreme Court has chosen to order oral arguments not only but also brief panelists at the United States Capitol and Washington, D.C., surrounding the Supreme Court.\\nThe biggest implications for the role of the Democratic Party appear in the most predictable way: Do we need more constitutional protections?\\nSeveral think that the nation may need more legal protections.\\nAmong the main priorities on a Republican side is the attempt to reverse passage of four major bills, or any legislation which increases the amount of money available for federal operations. This includes, as a precautionary measure, increasing federal spending for combating terrorism and Ebola, and boosting defense spending. Those bills included steps to strengthen internet privacy, increased gun ownership for gun owners, and increases in healthcare spending for citizens. Another point of concern is that the Constitutions First Amendment prohibits outright discrimination, but that refusal to provide voter data regarding eligible voters could, during a Congressional session, imperil campaign finance, further expand campaign financing and increase restrictions on the rich.\\nProgressives have called for a national definition of race to criminalize the behavior of higher education.\\nPrevention is not the only issue at stake.\\nSens. Orrin Hatch and Susan Collins (R-ME) have indicated that action to disarm and cut state and local gun-rights laws is an obvious and unlikely option. They also have released a joint Statement calling for the creation of a Joint State Plan of Action to protect gun-owning states from higher funding levels.\\nHowever, there is uncertainty over whether Democrats will go along with anyone invoking the Fourth Amendment to protect against social experimentation.\\nMembers of Congress have been reluctant to denounce a 2000 voting record as bowing to Republican political pressure to create new statess seats.\\nIn 2007, Jim Cooper proposed some changes to the GOP House bill of incorporation in order to block President Bushs much-promised move to expand the 10 states with the most gun-owning residents from controlling gun-ownership to controlling all immigration.\\n': '050121173508.txt',\n",

Were not telling you that, as everyone is now sold in their minds, in any way, and likely will become an obvious aphrodisiac in the weeks and months ahead, but you can be certain that none of us are going to be fully informed about what were getting into just because of time and cost.\\nRemember: It takes time and effort to sell an ounce of any marijuana plant, though its never too late to get out for yourself, and that makes the convenience of the products and the utility of the supply that much more intoxicating.\\nThe issue of medical marijuana has been gaining momentum for years, and the impact it could have on other consumers, but until recently, there has been no health insurer or other provider discussing the nuances of how they covered medical marijuana in their plans and implementation, or how that policy was enforced or if they had to have it.\\nRight now, theyre depending on government bureaucracies to pass bills for regulations that will effectively make it the consumers responsibility to comply with federal rules to cover marijuana sales (presumably with government guidance), and if they dont, states will have to regulate or establish medical marijuana as legal even though its already legal.\\nBecause of that, legal marijuana or not, there is a new and growing interest in cannabis, along with a growing number of Americans and the regulatory agencies that regulate and use it. We all know the regulatory track record when it comes to pot and we know that the U.S. is going to try very hard to find drug regulators that work to fully regulate marijuana and thus to the extent it is set up to operate at FDA standards.\\nSo what does it matter what we say?\\nNothing. Nothing except entertainment. I believe marijuana can be classified as a prescribed drug and should be controlled by elected officials, but I cant help but understand the consequences of such an assumption. It is not a legal drug and it is still very much in a bunch of pot strains, but legally issued to people upon the recommendation of doctors and state authorities.\\nWhat is so detrimental about legalization is how clearly politicians explain their programs, their statements, and their systems, when theyre not true.\\nIn a legislative framework, dispensaries are subject to state law, and adults are allowed to grow their own marijuana plants, but pot plants are regulated through a state-mandated program, which comes into effect in November. Enforcement is and has been fairly clear, so a person can grow his own marijuana plant and then not be able to come into an agent and need a permit from him to grow it.\\nThats not the case with medical marijuana. There is no path, nor a tax-free market, to producing medical marijuana. There is no national supply. There is no sales tax or a tax credit for healthy usage. There are no licensing requirements.\\nI believe the campaign against marijuana is over. I understand that because the Drug Enforcement Administration has the jurisdiction over its respective federal agencies, the Food and Drug Administration cant hire another agency to enforce its own policies. But in the end, Congress can get the Congress right because in the Constitution, it is a federal authority.\\nSure, a broad, long-term marijuana legalization strategy could work, but the nature of this strategy, and its costs and even its enormous potential downsides, have long been debated by the public.\\nRight now the biggest question facing the medical and consumer community is how to best ensure that the last possession of the 15 plants delivered to the patient when he or she presents with their marijuana, not only can marijuana sales comply with federal laws, but after paying their own taxes. Whats next? Weed law reform or the One Percent Rule thing?\\nOf course, those who vote on Tuesday will be guided by state law and what they perceive to be the needs of those still taking care of themselves.\\nThis is the time to go to the polls.\\nloyd.ciaderer@washpost.com\\n': '301120005442.txt',\n",

       "             'In reality, the effect of peppermint-spiked herb cocktails is really more akin to depegging a hole, says Johns Hopkins University. Scientists discovered the distinct effect of drug-modified peppers was so strong that they were making the bacterium process for making coffee.\\nThe breakthrough comes from observational tests to determine how people react to a whole host of other drinks. The researchers injected more pomodoro pepper extract in mice infected with AIDS than in humans, and the findings were so far consistent in the study that theyve tested only on mice.\\nIts not just potent alien enemies being made. Researchers also designed a system of bananas to simulate the personality traits of humans. In addition, the authors devised computer simulations based on people telling similar stories.\\nSo how does animal skin react to peppermint and weed? Doctors consider the two much like cats, but theyre not actors. The only difference is in the humans who were attacked. Bats wouldnt take kindly to growing peppermintand the monkeys were also sickened.\\nBut their reaction to peppermint wasnt particularly noticeable. In fact, people dont react, they think its harmless. Scientists say they cant be too sure the effect is on the insects and bacteria involved. Still, its unlikely such a thing is being done in people.\\nWe know that lots of people react to peppermint and weed supplements, says Patrick Wheeler, a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University and the studys lead author. Our study shows how these ancient poison extractions that are being made by people really dont affect animals in large quantities.\\nThe scientists tested all 2,200 adult blood samples and saw an average of eight different reactions. Yolks could be attached to those blood samples. The results showed higher benefits for rat brains and cats. The work, published in the journal Endocrinology and Metabolism, has been recently featured in TV shows including Dexter, CSI: NY, and Dateline.\\nBut this wasnt the first time researchers tested how marijuana interacts with peppermint.\\nResearchers followed mice fed marijuana to rats and mice fed green peppers. These rats exposed to the pomodoro pepper extract were more stressed and less able to keep two muscles from collapsing. And as long as rats got overstressed, the same effect on rats didnt show.\\nThe rats ate more pure rat protein, which prevented concomitant stress on their organs, the researchers write. The dogs ate lower stress.\\nWhile the rats also survived moderately well, their effects were significantly different among rats with the vegetarian option. Again, humans arent shown to have this very much effect.\\nWe can show its entirely normal and psychogenic and that there are more people affected than all of us, says Wheeler.\\nOne of the more surprising conclusions is that marijuana can trigger evolutionary fear. If a person becomes so fearful that the next thing hell do is cheat, it might come back to bite them in the ass in some shape or form.\\nFor now, all we know about how to say yes to peppermint and weed supplements is that the research wasnt done to test GM crops, or prevent human might from being genetically predisposed to disease.\\nPerhaps the only real test the researchers ran was to measure whether or not these drug-modified peppers were also causing animal nervous systems to take spiking.\\nPhoto: Fish Karam/Wikimedia Commons\\n': '301120005444.txt',\n",

Thats why to use Hemp Oil (an oil that is supposed to slow muscle-scarring inflammation and decrease oil production) and make sure you use it right when you grab an oatmeal cookie or drink its tea. The latter is not very addicting at all, since theres nothing better to cook or eat than an oatmeal cookie or a cup of tea.\\nOnce youve filled the Oatmeal Cookie Tea (and theres nothing better than oatmeal, tea or coffee or milk), just put in hemp oil. This oil will make your skin appear clearer and better as it grows  not so much since the oils in hemp fuel a chemical called Kene. Hemp Oil will significantly lower oil production, and it wont bring in an ever-increasing quantity of oil  but it does bring you tidier skin, which means theres less need for oil or product packaging.\\nTo increase the amount of oil in your skin, hemp oil is applied to the skin, making it easier to apply. Then, add hemp oil to your porcelain bowls and tableware to create a softness rich and attractive. Youll have a noticeable glow from your skin, which youll want to do  especially if youre taking your coffee and tea or eating a salad.\\nWhen you spray your oil on your oatmeal cookie, wash your eyes thoroughly and then spray the inside of your baggie, explains Malika Jackson, M.S., Ph.D., an analyst at Consumer Edge Research. Then, apply your hemp oil to the granular layers, hand dry, roll up your gloves and wrap your baggie. Do not avoid using the oil for exercise, even while using a salad.\\nTwo topical liners do a great job of absorbing hemp oil (or Kene), while hydrating skin is great for a healthy, colorful complexion. If youre running out of moisture, you can use hemp Oil Oxiderm, a fiber-rich Hemp oil that is engineered to remove chlorine and other harmful chemicals.\\nAdd one of these topical liners to your caulk package for easier firming; think fibrous lipstick which is glycolic, which results in unflavored powder being easier to fill and coat and can also promote fuller, smoother skin.\\nHere are the three liners on your moisturizer and mouthwash items (but some of them may not be as complete as others).\\nCapricorn Silk Pulse Wet Wipes and Conditioners for Octopussy, Crestor, Procrit, and Tazio Oils for Olam.\\nSet aside your wipes to dry with water or water your clothing for 10 minutes.

Run your wipes through a drop to dry through a cleaning pad.\\nUnused coffee, tea, and coffee brownies, ginger mugs, or other goodies have been given a coat and broken into small particles. To set aside these soap particles, apply a small amount of Oxiderm plus 1 teaspoon to blot:\\nMatch this to the liners and colour to the oil. Then, blot it with Sephora Mints (a scent that can help to shed any moisture).\\nKene and Loro Piana Oils are also great to rinse or lightly work on during the day, in which you want to rinse away any foam.

In the past, you have used a complicated scrub for the first few days to help break out the oil. Youll probably need the brush to combine with some oil to bring down the oil and your fine skin will burn, so avoid this thing.\\nEco toko Oil takes 100% organic hemp oil and chemically binds to an emulsifying plant material called kene.

       "             'Steve is a horticulturist of sorts. He raises orchids, Japanese maples, and other plants at his southern Rhode Island home. Tending the plants helps ease his rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pain, he says. But the garden offers more than Zen; he grows one plant -- marijuana -- specifically to relieve RA pain and discomfort. \"If my pain is at a 10, it will take it down to a 6 or 6.5,\" he says. \"Im an old-man weight lifter. After I smoke I am able to work my shoulders and arms to keep my joints healthy. It gives me the desire and ability to get through a workout.\" Steve has had permission to grow marijuana for medicinal purposes since 2006. He smokes it and cooks it in butter (for baking) and makes THC-containing solutions called tinctures (which can be added to foods and drinks) for himself and five other patients with various medical conditions. His home state is 1 of 16, along with the District of Columbia, where marijuana is permitted for medicinal use. Cannabis may be useful for people with RA and other chronic pain conditions because it can alleviate pain, reduce inflammation, and promote sleep. But unlike other pain-causing conditions, such as osteoarthritis, RA is associated with a higher risk of lung problems and heart attacks. (RA is an autoimmune condition that attacks the joints and causes multiple health problems.) Its not clear if smoking marijuana is a relatively safe pain reliever for people with RA, or if it could increase the risk of RA-associated conditions. And if cannabis is safe, its still debatable whether its safer to take it as a pill or mouth spray rather than smoking it. Smoking marijuana raises the heart rate and one study found that heart-attack risk rises fivefold in the hour after lighting up, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Medical marijuana remains controversial -- and thus under-studied -- in part because it is the most commonly abused illicit drug in the U.S. How marijuana works There are hundreds of chemicals in marijuana, but the best known is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. THC is what produces the high that comes with smoking or eating products made from marijuana. But THC also binds with receptors in the brain that produce an analgesic affect. It may also reduce anxiety experienced by some people dealing with chronic pain. Marijuana is typically smoked, which produces the most rapid delivery into the bloodstream, says Kathryn Cunningham, Ph.D., director of the Center for Addiction Research at the University of Texas Medical Branch, in Galveston. It can also be taken through vaporization (heated into a mist and inhaled), and in edible products, such as baked goods and tinctures, which take longer to have an effect because they have to be broken down in the stomach, Cunningham says. There are also drugs such as Marinol (dronabinol) and Cesamet (nabilone), which are synthetic versions of THC in pill form that are available by prescription for AIDS patients and cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, and a newer product called Sativex, a mouth spray with THC and cannabidiol. Sativex is not yet available in the United States, but is used in Canada and Europe for pain relief in people with cancer and multiple sclerosis. Marijuana is illegal on the federal level, but medicinal marijuana is permitted in some states, including Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Each state has its own guidelines including conditions it can be used for and possession limits (which range from 1 ounce to 24 ounces). Marijuana can be purchased through dispensaries, but most states also allow people to grow the product. Research is limited Medicinal marijuana isnt regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, and there arent large-scale studies of its safety and efficacy for chronic pain conditions. (It doesnt help that there are few manufacturers to fund research.) But there have been some small-scale studies looking at its use. A 2006 study in Rheumatology looked at 58 RA patients over a five-week period. They were split into two groups -- one taking Sativex and the other a placebo. The group on Sativex had improvements in \"morning pain on movement\" and sleep quality compared to placebo users. (The study was funded by GW Pharmaceuticals, which makes Sativex.) \"This is a good example of how to answer the question with scientifically sound experiments,\" Cunningham says, adding that larger studies are needed. \"We dont know how the drug affects the disease process, but it does seem to have a positive analgesic effect on RA.\" Doctors at the University of Toronto and Dalhousie University in Halifax reviewed 18 clinical trials that included 766 people between 2003 and 2010. The trials studied the use of cannabis -- either smoked or in THC-based prescription products -- as a medical therapy for non-cancer-related pain, most often neuropathic pain (chronic pain that is usually due to nerve damage). Fifteen of the trials found that it worked better than a placebo for pain relief and four trials found that it improved patients sleep. A majority of the studies found that side effects like sedation, dry mouth, dizziness, and disturbed concentration were mild enough that people did not drop out of the studies. However, the analysis included only one study of RA patients -- the same 2006 Sativex study -- so it could not determine if the long-term use of smoked marijuana was associated with a higher risk of heart or lung complications. Potential health risks Smoking marijuana can increase a persons heart rate for up to three hours, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Marijuana also contains carcinogens (possibly 50 percent to 70 percent more than cigarettes), making smoking potentially harmful to RA patients, who may already suffer from lung problems. The Institute on Drug Abuse, however, reported that no studies have linked marijuana use to lung or upper respiratory cancers. Safety of unregulated products is also always a concern. John Oram, Ph.D., cofounder of CW Analytical, a California-based scientific lab that tests medical marijuana products for safety, quality, and potency, says that more than 90 percent of what is on the market is safe. \"But about 10 percent or less is dangerous, and we dont know how unsafe it is and what problems it may cause,\" he says. Oram adds that labs like CW Analytical empower patients and doctors to make informed decisions about their alternative medicine options. Hazards of these products can include things like bacteria and mold, which would be illegal to sell in regulated food items. Some products may also be prepared in kitchens that arent licensed, may not adhere to refrigeration schedules, or may be made with allergens like peanuts, but not labeled as such. Oram says products should be tested within seven to eight weeks of purchase because that is the shelf life of cannabis. The dispensaries should have records of the date a product was tested for mold, yeast, bacteria, and pesticides, as well as its potency (or amount of THC). Not all doctors prescribe medicinal marijuana, even in states where it is permitted. Ogechi \"Helen\" Mbakwe, M.D., from Central Washington Internal Medicine and Endocrine Center, in Yakima, doesnt. Dr. Mbakwe is uncomfortable with the lack of control and regulation of medicinal marijuana. She says other medications, like methotrexate, treat the autoimmune disease at the root of the problem, and in turn can control pain and inflammation in combination with pain medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . (Methotrexate and other drugs are known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, or DMARDs, because they can actually slow down or prevent RAs damaging effect on the body.) On the other hand, while marijuana may help with pain symptoms, it does nothing for the disease progression or organ damage, Dr. Mbakwe says. \"If we mask these [symptoms] by giving them marijuana and giving them euphoria, the disease progression will keep getting worse and things like organ damage and severe problems will still occur,\" she notes. Steve, who has RA and lost one of his kidneys in 2004 after being diagnosed with cancer, feels he doesnt have a lot of choices to manage his pain. Many RA medications can be harmful to the kidneys, and that is one reason he says he opts for marijuana to treat his symptoms. Patients with kidney problems can still take DMARDs as long as their dose is adjusted and they are monitored closely, Dr. Mbakwe says. \"DMARDs are not simply pain medications and are not interchangeable with pain medications. So the question of exchanging an RA medication with marijuana should not arise.\" Another problem that Dr. Mbakwe encounters is that, even though she doesnt recommend marijuana to her RA patients, she has many who use it for pain, and she says these patients often have a tendency to abuse narcotics. \"Most patients looking for this have other chronic pain issues and are likely on other controlled substances,\" Dr. Mbakwe says. \"It can be difficult to see who has a tendency toward abuse potential.\" Gregory A. Smith, M.D., medical director of the Los Angelesbased Comprehensive Pain Relief Group, is a pain management and addiction specialist. He says marijuana is not a drug, like methamphetamine, that you take once and are physically dependent upon. \"Marijuana does not have that kind of chemical reaction in the brain,\" he says. \"It is safer than a lot of the prescription narcotics that I detox people from.\" About 28 million people try marijuana each year, and only between 8 percent and 10 percent of users exhibit addictive behavior like drug seeking, Cunningham says. \"What we need to know is if it is addicting in pain patients and is it more so than opiate medications,\" which are commonly used to treat chronic pain, she says. In the meantime, some patients will continue to use marijuana even though large studies havent tested its safety and efficacy. Steve, who has been using marijuana for 30 years (long before it was medically legal), smokes a bowl and a half every day and more at night. He says this helps him sleep and relieves pain, and he hasnt experienced any major side effects over the years, but admits that it can precipitate what he calls \"couch lock.\" \"It makes you lazy,\" he says.': '301120005439.txt',\n",
       "             'Sundae School, a cannabis lifestyle brand catering to Asian-Americans, produces its own smoking apparel and accessories inspired by the streets of Seoul, South Korea. The company places a heavy emphasis on fashion, but co-founder Dae Lim says theres a greater mission behind the brand which is fittingly celebrating its first anniversary on Friday, 4/20, with a pop-up shop in Brooklyn . In a cannabis industry heavily dominated by white businesses , Lim says he hopes to promote more Asian-American visibility. He told XXX its particularly important to him because Asian-Americans are so often erased from cannabis culture and mainstream media as a whole. If you look at the stoner experiences that are commonly depicted, its really singular typically a white guy out in Colorado or California surfing and smoking weed, said Lim, who started the business with his sister Cindy. But theres so many more layers to that. ...There are a lot of Asian-Americans and Asians in general adopting that lifestyle. Model minority myth-smashing messages and clever designs are baked into the clothing, with phrases like GPA 4.20 and Honor Roller printed on shirts and hoodies. Other pieces pull in some unapologetically traditional Asian elements. One collection is titled When Tigers Used To Smoke, a Korean phrase equivalent to the Western Once upon a time. Several pieces feature a tiger, a common motif in traditional Korean art. Another suit is a remix on the traditional Korean hanbok, featuring pockets designed to stash spliffs. People aren\\'t arresting us for no reason in the streets, but that doesn\\'t mean our issues aren\\'t real ... yellow invisibility is real in America.\" - Sundae School co-founder Dae Lim. Influenced by the growing counterculture both among young Koreans and Asian-Americans, Lim says that the designs attempt to reflect that unabashed self-expression among young, yellow youths. Lim told XXX that he aims to combat the erasure of Asian narratives through his companys practices, too. Sundae School is primarily Asian, he said, and when collaborating on design, it aims to elevate Asian work. Even the models cast in the companys fashion collections showcase diverse Asian backgrounds, with Nigerian-Korean model Han Hyun-Min featured in the Tigers collection . Supporting people from the Asian community is important for Lim, especially since the products are made for an Asian-American crowd. Because of the model minority myth, Asian-Americans arent necessarily dealing with being profiled on a plane, or people arent arresting us for no reason in the streets, but that doesnt mean our issues arent real, Lim said. Because muted yellow voices and yellow invisibility is real in America. Asian-American cannabis culture has been bubbling up for some time. However, the herb is still frowned upon by many in the Asian community, in part as a painful consequence of the Opium Wars, Splinter News pointed out , which left a lasting impression across Asia. So starting the business was no easy task for Lim. Lim noted that his parents first discovered his cannabis use years ago when he came to the U.S. for high school. He says his mother discovered his stash while cleaning his room and she broke down crying. Marijuana in Korean is literally Devils plant or Devils Lettuce, he said. So she said, What have we raised you as? Ive given up my career to educate you and take you to America and this is what you do to me? Later on, after he quit his job at consulting company McKinsey & Company to open a business, Lim said his mother was ecstatic. But she didnt find out about the cannabis angle to his work until she read a magazine article about Sundae School. Thats when all hell broke loose, he said. But at the end of the year, when she saw our business and how meaningful it was for us, she was more accepting. Lim says he understands the hesitation, since many Asian immigrants have strived to make it in America, keep their heads down and avoid trouble. They didnt have the privilege of learning about or enjoying the herb, he said. But now, Lim feels theres hope in reversing the stigma toward marijuana in the Asian-American community. It comes down to more education and awareness regarding the herb, and a little persistence.': '301120005451.txt',\n",
       "             'The Supreme Courts decision on Hobby Lobby, on June 13, 2012 might be good news for conservative activist causes.\\nOn Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) announced on Twitter that he would convene a special Senate committee to consider a bill that would bar the federal government from discriminating on the basis of gender. The bill, according to Reid, has been introduced in the Senate without clear majorities in both chambers.\\nWhich brings us back to Hobby Lobby (yes, its owned by a female small business owner). The point of the two bills is that they would restrict federal government rights that Hobby Lobby claims to cover. If Hobby Lobby is involved in any kind of business, that means it would be affected by federal statutes.\\nTake, for example, the Muslim ban. In the statute, the religious freedom clause provides that An employer has religious faith and that if something is unconstitutional, the employer must remove it immediately. Since Hobby Lobby is the landlord of the home of its principal owner, that legal function is the issue for the individual who finds the violation.\\nIt is ironic that this issue has brought between libertarians and right-wingers like Reid because the mainstream public should demand at least some Christian practice.\\nSenate Republicans, and not just the right-wing Senate, have made the issue of religious freedom a moral crusade that has thoroughly succeeded. Those same reasons have inspired the widely-publicized Romney-Ryan administrations new stance on the issue. (In fact, Mitt Romney once called religious liberty a sobriety for abortion.) But between Reid and Reid, the left has long had it both ways: It wants Hobby Lobby sued but it doesnt like Obamacare. Or it wants the town and state of Texas sued by Hobby Lobby under the Posse Comitatus Act.\\nIn an appeal last week, a Texas appeals court has again ruled that the Posse Comitatus Act is not a shield that protects the states right to regulate abortion, and, in fact, the three dissenting justices denied the plaintiffs broad request for injunctive relief.\\nAgain, this does not help Obamas argument that the Supreme Court struck down a provision of the Affordable Care Act requiring healthcare and insurance to cover contraception. (In this case, he obviously had the right to challenge it as a quid pro quo.)\\nIn a 2006 interview with Inquirer, Justice Stephen Breyer played up the notion that Hobby Lobby would have a problem if its own building were deemed illegal.\\nI think what would happen is Hobby Lobby would become the property of Texas, and we would not have an ability to license their business, Breyer said. We would stand firmly with Hobby Lobby.\\nHobby Lobby, Breyer said, is a lesbian or gay daycare center. Nothing about my religion would bring me justice, he said.\\nThe one thing that hasnt changed is the bigoted definition of full-time Hobby Lobby employees that the Supreme Court has used to define religious freedoms, not just religious insurance to claim contraceptive coverage. (Its not as if Hobby Lobby really has such privileges, but any religious liberty rights denied to their employees by a federal law, which they argue should not be used.)\\nIn a first-rate argument, Breyer said it is impossible to prove that discrimination is going on between employees because the state will not force them to provide the care they want. Not in the least, youd think, but then there was this question: When Hobby Lobby allowed anyone to sterilize, what would be the harm that would result from its bathroom policy?\\n': '301120105818.txt',\n",

Were allergic to it. And so, as someone known to eat a fire, I dont think we should feel the slightest bit of depression when, again, this stuff surfaces. Duh.\\nLard contains yeast, carcinogens, and sobs of glucose that are low in soluble, soluble and total sugars, and can cause allergic reactions and/or allergic reactions to foods. (The lack of sugar in our diets may be part of the reason people tend to eat it the way they do.)\\nAt any rate, we shouldnt stop at eating it. The meals that we eat at night should be hard to digest. Even dieting should require some occasional bouts of use, that for people accustomed to overconsumption of fruits and vegetables. In fact, many of us tend to eat our meals these days around an hour, even 30 minutes. Some parts of the diet that dont need a bite or a meal for an extended period should be available throughout the day.\\nEven so, its worth noting that there are simple steps we can take to get our food near the taste buds. Heres how:\\n1. Dont just do it to the rat. Theres more to weight loss than dieting. Finding your favorite foods near the grind should also be challenging. Never once should we actually eat scraps of food, but insteadin essencecut things (e.g., nuts, oranges, squash, etc.). Never again should we put anything (or anyone) inside a meal that will lead to another craving. (Do not eat any gluten, eggs, dairy products, meat, fruit, fish, vegetables, etc.) Making a meal every half hour or so outside will actually lead to more weight gain.\\n2. Eat out within the recommended time range. If you eat out, make sure youre doing so sooner than later. Healthier and more accessible portions of food will lead to more weight gain, so make sure to take regular breaks to eat healthier foods. If you spend any extra time chasing after what you dont want, keep others coming back. If you miss some fun, good eats (such as steamed broccoli or carrots), eat and drink non-alcoholic beverages (e.g., beer or wine) that will prevent you from spending more time eating than you should.\\n3. Wait until symptoms are well understood before you can buy a drink. If there are symptoms, seek medical help, but as always, you should hear your doctor. He or she will be able to diagnose and treat any type of food allergy or intolerant condition before it happens. Treating food allergy or intolerance are both not easy, but you can get the early treatment needed with an easy-to-prove ingredient. If its a rash, its OK to pop it on your arm, but be sure to tell your doctor about the little disc one (which attaches itself to the digestive tract) so you know whats inside.\\n4. Eat with candies. If you drink a bottle of wine, have the responsible bottle owners check your weight and composition for the sweetener in that drink. Even fine wine consumption, which may involve medicine, is not the same as this. People who eat more than four times a week or consume more than ten times as much contain blood sugars, lab-tested test results show. So its better to remain abstinent than not.\\n5. Begin by mastering what works best for you. Even if you have no products to direct you to, dont use them right away. (They may have defects or theyre being misused with whole grain or other quinoa.) A meal wont even replace it. Take baby steps towards taking the habit home. If youre really old, a kitchen chef, or a large group of friends can cook meals for you after youve figured out what works best for you, you could improve your skills at cooking by going to a cooking school or getting your teacher on how to make do with snacks or a granola bar. If youre at home, clean out your closets. Look into making a laundry list.\\nIf youre used to massaging your kitchen floor to keep it fresh and youre totally grown-up, you might want to move over to eating out.

Proponents of Proposition 64 are using marijuana prescriptions as preparation for identification procedures for users, including fingerprint identification.\\nHow to legally go about it?\\nThe limits and requirements apply only to marijuana; the California proposition states that dispensary owners, medical-marijuana prescribers, prosecutors, and patients can only get their mail delivered with the prescribed dosage of marijuana. Even if you are under the age of 21, there are no marijuana-delivery requirements required for medical pot or tobacco-powered cigarettes.\\nHowever, opponents of Prop 64 claim that marijuana is to blame for serious rates of fatal traffic accidents in California, as well as for traffic-related fatalities.\\nProponents of Prop 64 initially tried to ban the sale and possession of marijuana in open state liquor stores but moved on to limit the number of grams of the drug in grocery stores.\\nMeanwhile, opponents of the legal sale of marijuana also panned the Equal Access Act that was proposed by Attorney General Kamala Harris to limit access to pot.\\nIn stark contrast to our ambitious goals of protecting and curing all our citizens, this massively expanded provision in our constitution increases legalized marijuana access to Texans and others for only a small fraction of the cost (i.e. several thousand dollars per gram), Harris said in a statement.\\nHarris touted the success of the Equal Access Act, as well as the initiatives to legalize medical marijuana.\\nMedical marijuana is a medical product that has been proven to be safe and effective in helping patients live productive lives. The number of states in which medical marijuana is being legalized in this country is increasing rapidly, Harris said.\\nLegalization and regulation\\nPrescription-strength marijuana is legal in 26 states and the District of Columbia, and dispensaries in 33 states and Washington, D.C., currently sell it to those who can afford it. But those shops are regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\\nBack in October, a coalition of groups that oppose the state and federal marijuana laws gathered in Richmond, California, to argue that such a ruling would be unauthorized. Additionally, a lawmaker from Massachusetts, due to his research on medical marijuana, was forced to withdraw the required marijuana education-education program after he obtained opposition from the state Senate.\\nGet the latest round of breaking news right here.\\n': '301120105812.txt',\n",

I dont have anywhere to go. Im either going to pick him up or leave him.\\nThe Houston Tribune reports:\\nGodfrey then contacted the Houston-based attorney representing Ted Evans, the unlicensed real estate developer and marijuana grower who filed an injunction seeking to stop legal efforts by city officials to stop the city from paying temporary child support payments. To make the request, Evans worked with the state Department of Human Services. The city has not paid for almost two years, and attorneys are actively seeking to get Evans to pay the remainder. Evans thinks it is costing him tens of thousands of dollars. He argues that in the Houston case, Texas law already protects, and not limited to, child support payments to family members. Theres little standard of proof as to why it should be that way, Evans said. If Im getting $38,000 from the city, the city will just pay for it.\\nResidents of Houston are keeping a keen eye on the long process of legalizing pot:\\nThe charge that cities can block child support payments to older people because the state cannot afford to keep buying them has been overturned in recent weeks after a Supreme Court ruling. The ruling was based primarily on a constitutional argument that cities are constitutionally protected from seeking to withhold the existence of funds for children. But in a potential shift, a federal court ruled that cities cannot block child support payments to those using property to pay for the living costs of children born to parents who have used property to obtain child support in the past. (A second ruling sided with the lower court and resulted in a $115.5 million settlement.)\\nThe case came up again Wednesday, and was dealt with by a federal judge.

What about marijuana or drugs related to sex?

Of course, this is a whole lot different, and it makes me wonder what role the Federal Drug Administration, which is the central FDA regulatory agency, is taking in all of this:\\nFDA policy-makers have no authority to review and modify drug design, development or safety. Only regulations developed to address drug development, clinical development, safety, compliance, organizational reviews and licensing procedures are appropriate. Of course, FDA policy-makers do not have the power to reinstate prohibitions against drug development based on clinical test results.\\nInterestingly, I never asked what in the FOGN word legal about recreational marijuana use  especially at this time of year, when the whole cabinet of people likes to say it's a terrible idea, and when we collectively welcome medicinal marijuana in addition to recreational. You know, you save money by doing pot and it makes everyone more money. But they don't give much away: there's no unlimited line items so the FTC has no power to release its medicated records of cannabis use. And the government's reach is limited: there are no guidelines for these labs or that block list of drugs on which you can buy medications in a federal marketplace, which meant that they have no one to base their own conclusions on in public hearings.\\nToday, I've heard far less from politicians than I have from people who don't have any fun at all from explaining the various ways in which regulators can regulate drugs. But what about the Congress, and what about ICE, just in case you read this by mistake? If you were ever stopped by ICE officers and your name was Solange, and people are finding out your name was Solange Rannoff, imagine the outcry if ICE arrests you without any of these other identifiers, and reports that you were involved in sexual assault? Imagine that. Would the Federal Bureau of Investigation have a small mission in all those people? Would ICE deny that applicant a visa?

So it's best to play it safe, not so much that we'll be ruined with any new drugs or cops on the streets, but that we become more informed and curious about which drugs we'll hit in the street in the future.\\nHere's the last thing I want to say about marijuana: it's a great idea, and the Democrats will never be able to force marijuana to be legal again, because they won't support you, so there's a good chance in one way or another we'll have to either be careful with it or open up marijuana.

       "             'A scientist in the United Kingdom has found that compounds derived from marijuana can kill cancerous cells found in people with leukemia, a form of cancer that is expected to cause an estimated 24,000 deaths in the United States this year. \"Cannabinoids have a complex action; it hits a number of important processes that cancers need to survive,\" study author Dr. Wai Liu, an oncologist at St. George\\'s University of London, told XXX. \"For that reason, it has really good potential over other drugs that only have one function. I am impressed by its activity profile, and feel it has a great future, especially if used with standard chemotherapies.\" Liu\\'s study was recently published in the journal Anticancer Research. It was supported by funding from GW Pharmaceuticals, which already makes a cannabis-derived drug used to treat spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis. The study looked at the effects of six different non-psychoactive cannabinoids -- compounds derived from marijuana that do not cause the \"high\" associated with its THC ingredient -- when applied alone, and in combination, to leukemia cells. Cannabinoids displayed a \"diverse range of therapeutic qualities\" that \"target and switch off\" pathways that allow cancers to grow, Liu told U.S. News & World Report . Liu stressed to XXX that his research was built around the testing of the six purified cannabinoid forms -- not traditional cannabis oil, which Liu described as \"crude\" in comparison and generally containing 80-100 different cannabinoids. \"We do not really know which are the ones that will be anticancer and those that may be harmful,\" Liu said. During the study, Liu and his team grew leukemia cells in a lab and cultured them with increasing doses of the six pure cannabinoids, both individually and in combination with each other. His study says the six cannabinoids were CBD (Cannabidiol), CBDA (Cannabidiolic acid), CBG (Cannbigerol), CBGA (Cannabigerolic acid), CBGV (Cannabigevarin) and CBGVA (Cannabigevaric acid). Liu and his team then assessed the viability of the leukemia cells and determined whether or not the cannabinoids destroyed the cells or stopped them from growing. Although promising, Liu also said that it remains unclear if the cannabinoid treatment would work on the 200-plus existing types of cancer. \"Cancer is an umbrella term for a range of diseases that fundamentally differ in their cellular makeup, [and] which occur as a result of disturbances to growth controls,\" Liu said. \"Chemotherapy works by disrupting these dysfunctional growth signals. Therefore, any cancers that have these profiles should respond to the chemotherapy. It just so happens that a number of cannabinoids can target these very same mechanisms that make cancer what it is, and so any cancer that exhibits these faults should respond well to cannabinoids. The flip side is, of course, that other cancers may not have these same genetic faults and so cannabinoids may not work as well.\" According to the Centers for Disease Control, 7.6 million people die from various forms of cancer each year worldwide. When asked if smoking marijuana has the same or similar effects as ingesting the pure cannabinoid compounds he studied, Liu said he thinks it\\'s unlikely. \"Smoking cannabis introduces a number of potential problems,\" Liu said. \"First, the complex makeup of cannabis that contains about 80 bioactive substances means that the desired anticancer effect may be lost because these compounds may interfere with each other. Second, we see that delivering the drug either by injection or by a tablet would ensure the most effective doses are given. Smoking would be variable, and indeed the heat of the burning may actually destroy the useful nature of the compounds.\" In 2012, researchers at the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco found that CBD (cannbidiol), a non-toxic, non-psychoactive chemical compound found in the cannabis plant, could stop metastasis in many kinds of aggressive cancer . The National Cancer Institute has also funded some research into cannabis and cancer , including a 2012 study that looked at the effects cannabis compounds have on slowing the progression of breast cancer , spokesman Michael Miller told U.S. News and World Report. However NCI has not funded research on the effects of cannabinoids on leukemia. Liu stressed that much work is still needed, and said that finding support for marijuana-derived medicines can be polarizing. \"Although there is much promise, I struggle to find enough support to drive this work on,\" Liu said. \"The mention of cannabinoids can polarize the public, who understandably link cannabis smoking with cannabis-derived drugs.\" Liu told the Seattle PI\\'s Pot Blog that he hopes to start clinical trials involving humans in 12 to 18 months.': '050121173307.txt',\n",

In Washington and Colorado, meanwhile, voters passed an initiative to allow pot for recreational use.

In Colorado alone, sales topped $181 million in 2010, and the business employed 4,200 state-licensed workers, says Aaron Smith, executive director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, a nonprofit trade group that campaigns for marijuanas federal legalization. In addition to profiting itself from growing and selling marijuana, the industry benefits a slew of other businesses, such as insurers, lawyers and agricultural-equipment firms, experts say. Call it the green rush, says Derek Peterson, CEO of GrowOp Technology, an online retailer of hydroponics products used in the cultivation of indoor plants and a subsidiary of OTC stock Terra Tech. The industry is expanding, and there are all kinds of investment opportunities. For regular investors looking to get in on the action and without having to actually grow or sell drugs there are several small-cap stocks that stand to gain from marijuanas growing acceptance. Medbox, an OTC stock with a $45 million market cap, for example, sells its patented dispensing machines to licensed medical-marijuana dispensaries. The machines, which dispense set doses of the drug, after verifying patients identities via fingerprint, could potentially be used in ordinary drugstores too, says Medbox founder Vincent Mehdizadeh. Based in Hollywood, Calif., the company already has 130 machines in the field, and it expects to install an additional 40 in the next quarter. The smart money is trying to help with compliance and transparency, Mehdizadeh says. Of course, investing in drugs the federal government still outlaws poses enormous risks to investors, says Sam Kamin, a law professor and the director of the Constitutional Rights & Remedies Program at the University of Denver. In fact, nearly 500 of the estimated 3,000 dispensaries nationwide have either been closed by the federal government or shut down in the past year, says a spokesman for StickyGuide.com, an online directory and review site for medical marijuana dispensaries and yet another ancillary business thats currently seeking investors.': '050121173305.txt',\n",

But scientists are still trying to determine if the chemicals in microbials are cancer killers.\\nThe research, published today in the journal Nature Chemistry, by Swiss scientists Blaise Felberg and Stefan Molinini, is the most promising yet. The scientists spent several years studying healthy volunteers and showed they activate tens of microbials that collect glycoprotein, a protein found in blueberries. The scientists then worked to build special pockets of microbials that regulate glycoprotein secretion within tumor cells and have a direct impact on the overall tumor response to drugs.\\nGlycoprotein induces the production of anti-cancer cytokines called cytosine interferon and torquinamide, which are properties of the plant compounds in microbials.

Also, restaurants, cafes and coffee shops will be allowed to set up a separate room or glass partition behind which people can smoke. But customers will not be served in these areas to protect staff.

There aren't many heroin or meth users out there developing a hobbyist's interest in producing their drug. &#x200B;Or the idea that use of heroin or meth will maintain or increase at legalization, and I certainly don't believe that. The crowd that isn't doing meth and heroin aren't avoiding it because of legal repercussions. &#x200B;While legal marijuana almost definitely increased the rate of marijuana DUI cases, I find it a similarly hollow claim that heroin and meth users would cause more DUIs if it was legal. Perhaps some, but again, marijuana isn't like meth and heroin. Marijuana DUI cases are likely as high as they are because it's so easy for so many to get away with it. I don't necessarily believe that there's going to be thousands of meth heads mixed into my traffic if they only thing they have to fear is a DUI. &#x200B;Nor can the War on Drugs take credit for ancillary crimes found when chasing drugs.

There's no reason to think cops are powerless unless they are chasing drugs.&#x200B;At the end of the day though, none of it touches on the real true failings of the War on Drugs. In the world of narcotics law enforcement, there aren't victims. There are users and dealers. Treating drug addiction like a health problem and trying to solve it as such is proven to be more effective than punitive punishments, and you simply cannot balance a medical approach while at the same time pursuing criminal charges against drug users.

Insurers, after hearing the findings, received a $69.5 million estimate from the Department of Insurance for a 2014 crash involving two vehicles, according to its report.\\nThe analysis finds consumers can claim a higher premium from car insurance companies than they can from Florida or Hawaii because of recent fatal crashes involving 2014 caravans in the state\\'s local law enforcement departments.

       "             'Black farmers in Florida say they are being shut out from the state\\'s emerging medical marijuana trade, and are pushing for changes in the law that would let them break into the limited, legal pot market. Though Sunshine State voters last fall rejected a broad medical marijuana ballot proposal, a more narrow measure ( Senate Bill 1030 ) was signed by Gov. Rick Scott nearly a year ago. The \"Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act of 2014\" allows some nurseries to grow \"low-THC\" pot and distribute to \"qualified patients\" suffering from cancer, seizures and muscle spasms. But for black growers in the state, \"It\\'s a bad thing,\" said Florida Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association President Howard Gunn Jr. Gunn is referencing one line in the law that is creating controversy. It states farmers must have a license to cultivate \"more than 400,000 plants\" and must have operated \"as a registered nursery in [Florida] for at least 30 continuous years.\" According to Gunn, hardly any black farmers meet that criteria. \"There weren\\'t that many black farmers 30 years ago in the nursery business,\" he said. \"We say they weren\\'t there because of the discriminatory practices set by the USDA.\" Gunn is talking about a case called \"Pigford v. Glickman,\" which started in the 1980s -- it led to one of the largest civil rights settlements in history, worth $1.3 billion. The USDA agreed to compensate thousands of black farmers who allegedly suffered racial discrimination from the USDA\\'s farm loan program. Gunn points to that history in explaining why few, if any, black farmers would meet the criteria today to legally grow medical marijuana. \"Because of that, we weren\\'t able to produce as much or be as profitable as [other] farmers,\" he said. \"If we found one [black] farmer growing that many plants, it would be surprising.\" There\\'s an effort afoot in the legislature to address these concerns, but it got off to a rocky start. After an outcry from black farmers opposing the \"unobtainable\" requirement to grow pot, Sen. Oscar Braynon, a black Democrat from Miami, proposed an amendment to a separate bill to get rid of the 30-year, 400,000-plant requirement. The underlying bill -- which would end legal challenges associated with the 2014 version -- was authored by Senate Regulated Industries Chairman Rob Bradley, a Republican who played a major role in passing the 2014 law. Bradley reportedly asked Braynon to withdraw the amendment -- promising he would work on changing the \"discriminatory\" language in the bill. But that plan did not work out. The session ended prematurely, and neither the bill nor the amendment won approval. \"Unfortunately, the bill did not make it across the finish line,\" Bradley told XXX, He said they will work to address the issue when lawmakers return. \"I think [black farmers] have a legitimate issue and it\\'s something that we will certainly continue to try and address when we\\'re back in session next year,\" he said. Meanwhile, the sponsor of the original 2014 bill, state Rep. Matt Caldwell, said he was not aware of the potential effects the requirements would have on black farmers. \"I thought the ones who\\'ve been here the longest should be the first in line,\" he told The News Service of Florida . Florida isn\\'t the only state working on changing marijuana laws. Georgia\\'s governor recently signed a bill that will legalize low-THC cannabis oil for certain patients with illnesses. Around the same time, the state of Washington -- where smoking pot is legal -- created a law that implements a voluntary registry of patients and cracks down on illegal pot gardens.': '050121173107.txt',\n",

During the liberal cable news networks year-end broadcast from Times Square, reporter Randi Kaye did several, um, hits from Denver, where marijuana is legal. At various points, she held a joint, lit a bong, marveled over a special gas mask used by stoners and wondered where she was. Kaye didnt partake herself while on the air, but the bit was enough to appall some viewers and confuse people who might be locked up for doing the same thing. CNN is trying to trademark the debauchery as its brand for New Year\\'s Eve coverage. I mean that quite seriously, Media Research Center President Brent Bozellsaid on Tuesday, while explaining that the network no longer has comic Kathy Griffin using obscenities to attract viewers. (Griffinwas famously fired after she posed with a fake decapitated head made to look like that of President Donald Trump.) So this year they\\'re doing pot and getting stoned, Bozellsaid. For much of the morning on Tuesday, The Drudge Report led its site with a story headlined: CNNs stoner new year! Bong lessons on news network.\" Meanwhile, TheBlaze spent a segment of Glenn Becks radio program breaking down the pot-themed report. CNN showed America how to do bong hits. Isnt that great?

More potheads, increase in cases of schizophrenia, psychosis, more impaired driving ... as #BigWeed makes billions. The story took another turn on Tuesday when WSB-TV reporter Tyisha Fernandes tweeted that 70 people were arrested when less than an ounce of marijuana was found at a house party. Since nobody claimed it, the police arrested everyone. Many people took to Twitter to point out what they described as hypocrisy between Fernandes report and what CNN had advocated on New Years Eve. But yet CNN just did their whole New Years Eve coverage on a Weed Party Bus, one user wrote , while another added , They smoking weed on CNN tho.

Because we all are young people who tend to have different sets of symptoms and/or feelings, it seems to be correlated between drinking a marijuana plant and being high. But its not clear if this is linked to high blood pressure or if these are both the same thing.\"\\nAre smoking marijuana related?\\nExperts are fully supportive of efforts to restrict access to marijuana, said Wendy McCloud, a research fellow at Clark County Health Department.\\nWe are certainly working toward limiting access to marijuana and restricting access to it to children, she said.\\nUnderstanding habits\\nSmoking is not to blame for an increase in serious medical conditions, said Nadore.

       "             'A review of 25 years worth of car crash data has found a link between the so-called \"high holiday\" celebrated by marijuana users on April 20 (4/20) and a rise in fatal car accidents. The significance of the date is debated, but has been linked to the story of a group of students in San Rafael, Calif., who used to meet after school at 4:20 pm to smoke pot. The study conducted at the University of British Columbia looked at U.S. government statistics from 1992 - the year after an article in High Times magazine popularized the informal event - through 2016. Researchers compared fatalities on that date to those one week before and after it and found there to be a 12 percent increase on average, which represents 142 deaths. The study\\'s authors hypothesized a connection based on previous research that suggests driving after marijuana use is \"surprisingly common\" and can increase crash risk. Other studies have found a similarly elevated risk linked with alcohol and driving on Super Bowl Sunday and New Year\\'s Eve. Most accidents had no police data on drug testing so there\\'s no way to confirm that marijuana was involved, but researchers think the drug was responsible for some crashes. The study was published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine. \"It\\'s a really relevant question to be thinking about now since legalization seems to be progressing across the United States and in Canada,\" Staples said. Marijuana is legal for medical use in most U.S. states and in Canada; recreational use has been legalized in nine states plus Washington, D.C. and is expected to become legal in Canada in July. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, marijuana can impair driving ability. However, the U.S. agency also notes that directly linking marijuana with car crashes can be difficult because it\\'s often used while drinking alcohol. An earlier survey of college freshmen found that driving after marijuana use and riding with someone using pot was common, especially among young men, and more common than alcohol-linked driving. And a 2014 study in six states found that marijuana was increasingly detected in drivers killed in car crashes during a 10-year period. It\\'s a recognized risk in Colorado, where voters approved legalizing it in 2012. Last year the state\\'s transportation department partnered with Lyft and a pot industry group to offer discounted rides for pot users partaking in 4/20 festivities. The program runs through April this year. Data show that 15 percent of DUI arrests in Colorado last year involved marijuana, and a 2016 survey found about half of users in the state think driving under the influence of pot is safe. Dr. Andrew Monte, an emergency medicine physician and toxicology expert at the University of Colorado, said his hospital typically sees a slight increase in marijuana-using patients on April 20, but that vomiting and intoxication are more common reasons than car crash injuries. Still, he said the study offers an important message. \"We think about cannabis as being ubiquitous in our society,\" he said. \"However we need to realize that people should not be using this and driving.\"': '050121173114.txt',\n",
       "             'The Medical Board of California has revoked the license of a doctor in Los Angeles who told a father to give marijuana cookies to his son as a way to treat the boys temper tantrums. The doctor, William S. Eidelman a natural medicine physician, according to his website made the recommendation in September 2012, according to the board. However, the board made the decision to revoke the doctors license in December. Eidelman made the recommendation after the father, who has not been identified, brought his then 4-year-old son to see the doctor because his son had episodes of uncontrollable behavior and temper tantrums which was causing the boy trouble at school, according to the state medical board\\'s decision . After Eidelman met with the pair for roughly 20 or 30 minutes, he diagnosed the boy with a probable combination of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) and Bipolar Disorder before recommending the father give his son small quantities of cannabis in cookies, the board wrote. Its important to note the board did not revoke his license because he recommended giving marijuana to a small child.In fact,\"it has not been established, by clear and convincing evidence, that the recommendation of medical marijuana to [the boy], with his father\\'s consent, violated the standard of care,\" the board\\'s decision states. Rather, the medical board said the doctor committed gross negligence\" becauseEidelman during the appointment with the 4-year-old and his father did not observe the boy having a temper tantrum or uncontrollable behavior. He also did not contact the boys school for more information on his alleged behavior, nor did he obtain any medical records for the boy or refer him to a psychiatrist for a proper diagnosis, among other reported missteps. Eidelman also relied on family history to make his diagnosis, which the board in its decision saidis not itself a symptom of either condition. The board began to investigate Eidelman after the boys school became aware that the child was being given cannabis. The boys father reportedly asked a nurse at the school to give his son another marijuana-laced cookie during lunchtime because his son was misbehaving that day. The San Bernardino County Sheriff\\'s Office and child protective services were subsequently notified, which sparked an investigation. This later led the medical boards review. On his website, Eidelman who was previously placed on probation in 2004 after giving marijuana prescriptions to undercover police officerswithout a proper reason, according to documents said he is appealing the boards decision. He also asked his patients to write letters to the California Medical Board on his behalf. While the boards revocation of his license was effective as of Jan. 4, Eidelman is continuing to practice at this time because a San Francisco County Superior Court judge issued a stay of the revocation pending his appeal, he wrote. Documents filed in The Superior Court of California Tuesday show the temporary stay was granted. From the beginning of my career, Ive been looking for things that really worked and werent toxic. And cannabis really works, Eidelman told The Los Angeles Times of his decision to recommend marijuana as a treatment, adding he has written more than 10,000 letters recommending cannabis to patients over the last 20 years. In a statement to XXX on Wednesday, Eidelman said he is \"confident he will prevail\" in the hearing, which is scheduled for March 12. The whole prosecution was wrong from the first step of the investigation to the abuses of discretion by the Administrative Law Judge, Eidelman said. \"I am confident I will prevail in the hearing.\"': '050121173118.txt',\n",

By comparison, it can take years for the family to walk out on them.\\nOlder women who have difficulty gaining access to a form of medication that can provide the best support in helping them in the struggle to fight their deaths are often reluctant to exercise it, so they turn to hallucinogens or other medication for relief.\\nTypically the opioids are the most popular right now, according to Dr. Lisa Thompson, who is chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Georgetown Universitys Perelman School of Medicine. But people typically do not need opioids for treatments for opioid addiction.\\nDr. Glenn McKay, a professor of surgery at the Georgetown School of Medicine, explains that end-of-life health and addiction issues may be caused by feelings of helplessness and isolation, problems with pregnancy or cancer, or depression. Often people struggle at first with figuring out how to take care of themselves, McKay says. Its hard for them to even think about what to do.\\nMedication helps, too, she says.\\nHeroin is a super drug, says Dr. Eugene Boyd of the American Psychiatric Association.

Those over the age of 45 are also a particularly vulnerable group, and even have limited access to cancer treatment.\\nWhile marijuana is cheap and effective for those who need it, heroin and prescription painkillers also tend to treat conditions such as post-traumatic stress and psychosis. Studies also show an emotional attachment among those using opioids to stay home from work and at home with sick kids.\\nThe end of an addiction and the start of an addiction make the dysfunctional nature of these communities worse, says James Salile of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in Los Angeles. He points to the example of his mother, who developed a chronic illness. A lot of people find the effects of addiction to be overwhelming, Salile says. But other factors like stress and fear often eat into the ability to stay in your parents home and manage that dysfunction, thats the bottom line.\\nMaking cannabis accessible doesnt have to be politically divisive. An overwhelming amount of Americans are openly fighting legalization of the drug, and it can be just as culturally conservative. But thats not happening now. Massachusetts civil service law has passed provisions allowing employee grievances to trump marijuana prohibition, a federal law that hasnt brought any opposition from anyone. This means that workers who are on the verge of a lawsuit against a city might soon have their civil rights suppressed.\\nIts clear that marijuana is already a socially acceptable remedy in many settings. In recent years, that trend may continue. A 2016 Pew Research poll found that 90 percent of Americans still favor marijuana for medical purposes. And its clear that without legalization the conditions that can easily be induced by the drug arent fair to the patient.\\n': '291020230457.txt',\n",
       "             'at 9:00 AM Diana Calvert, manager of the River City Retail Marijuana Dispensary in Merlin, Ore., stocks the shelves with product. (Timothy Bullard/Grants Pass Oregons Daily Courier/Associated Press) I had a medical marijuana card for nearly two years before I worked up the nerve to buy legal weed. Living in laid-back Vermont, I had access to a friends homegrown herb, which my husband used to make me cannabis-infused coconut butter in the family Crock-Pot. Applying the butter topically soothed my chronic pelvic pain and relieved symptoms of the debilitating bladder syndrome that had plagued me for a decade and warranted the card. Occasionally, I ingested a tiny lick of butter during a flare-up an imprecise home remedy. I savored the full-body relaxation that followed but loathed the disorienting mental side effects. Id been a cannabis skeptic from the start: I never much liked getting high for fun, tending to feel nervous and paranoid rather than happy and chill. I also carried childhood shame about catching my mom smoking a little pipe in secret the strange pungent smell, her altered state, her mortified reaction when I walked in on her. And I worried that using more cannabis would alter me in turn, distance me from my children and prevent good parenting. How wrong I was. It turns out the costs of living with chronic pain and depression are far greater than the risks of using medical marijuana to help those conditions. This past summer, although I was physically pain-free, a sudden depression knocked me to the ground. Crippled by anxiety and insomnia, I struggled to get out of bed and function for my two daughters, ages 10 and 12, who had both experienced some depression themselves. Id read in Scientific American that mood disorders may be passed genetically from mother to daughter , and I feared what my girls would learn from watching me break down in tears or lash out in rage. Even in the fog of despair, I knew taking care of myself was essential to my ability to take care of them. Diana Whitney says Americans are starting to dispel the shame and secrecy around cannabis. For her, this means she doesnt have to hide in a backroom with a secret pipe, as her mother did. (Carmen Whitney/) When my therapist-husband gave me Victoria Costellos memoir, A Lethal Inheritance: A Mother Uncovers the Science Behind Three Generations of Mental Illness, I took its message to heart: One of the best things a depressed parent can do to help a child prone to mental illness is to treat her own depression. So I went to my doctor, but all he could offer was a prescription for Ativan, an anti-anxiety med, and an increase in my antidepressant dosage. I was already going to therapy, practicing yoga and exercising regularly. Rather than become dependent on benzodiazepines or suffer more pharmaceutical side effects, I got out my green card and made an appointment at the local dispensary. The modest office felt like a hippie health spa, with green-and-white decor and posters displaying different plant strains. My consultant, Mike, quickly put me at ease with his cheerful brown eyes and gentle manner. Clad in jeans and plaid flannel, Mike told me that cannabis had been his exit drug from opiates, then listened carefully to my history of chronic pain and depressed mood. He explained the healing properties of endocannabinoids and cited a recent study in which cannabis significantly reduced reports of stress, anxiety and depression, especially in women. Because I didnt like to smoke and wanted minimal psychoactive effects, Mike recommended I try microdosing taking small amounts of cannabis to reap the therapeutic benefits without getting stoned. I took home a tin of indica-dominant butter-mints, some salted caramel gummies and a high-CBD oral tincture. (Indica strains of cannabis tend to be more sedating and relaxing; CBD, or cannabidiol , is a non-psychoactive cannabis compound with anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties.) The sativa-strain gummies were strangely activating and made me irritable, but even one tiny buttermint allowed me a blissful nights sleep. And the oral tincture proved the holy grail one dropper-full to relieve anxiety and sustain a mellow relaxation for hours. Within a week, I felt my depression lighten, and for the first time all summer, I could laugh with my family. Stigmas and false stereotypes have surrounded marijuana use since the 1930s, when it was classified a federal Schedule 1 substance, like heroin. Maybe because of this disrepute, I never expected the gifts of cannabis to go beyond symptom relief. But Ive discovered that the plant slows me down and tunes me in, softens my competitive edges. When I microdose, I experience a heightened sense of gratitude and patience, as well as lighthearted humor. Joining the kids on the couch for a lovefest with the dog or playing a family game of cards, I feel more present, more grounded in my body, free from mental agitation. Other mothers have told me they enjoy these benefits, too. Jane Lanza, a yoga teacher certified in cannabis science and medicine through the University of Vermonts Robert Larner, M.D. College of Medicine, says she sees cannabis as a healthier alternative to the socially accepted wine mom culture, especially when taken in small amounts. The cannabis medicine we use is the feminized version of the plant, Lanza told me at a canna-wellness retreat I attended with my husband, adding that cannabis growers cull the male plants and use the flowering female plants for the cannabinoids they produce. The spirit of healing I receive from medical cannabis is nurturing and supportive, Lanza said. It amplifies positive feelings for me, so I experience greater love, patience and compassion when it comes to my kids. I hope that, by speaking honestly about my own use, more women will come out of the cannabis closet, a crucial step toward ending the stigma. While Im grateful for my medical card, I recognize how my white privilege and economic advantages play into my access to cannabis. Marijuana prohibition has racist origins, and the criminalization of cannabis continues to disproportionally affect people of color. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, black people are 3.7 times as likely as whites to be arrested for marijuana. Its ironic and unjust that many mothers of color are in prison for using the same plant that has benefited me. Meanwhile, the tide of legalization keeps rising. Although federal law still classifies marijuana as an illegal drug, 10 states plus the District have legalized recreational cannabis, while 33 states and the District now allow adult medical use . To our north, Canada just became the first major industrialized nation to fully legalize cannabis. Clearly, were starting to dispel the shame and secrecy around cannabis. This means I dont have to hide in a backroom with a secret pipe, like my mother did. My daughters see the green, zipped lock-bag where I keep my tinctures and edibles. They know I take the medicine to help with pain, depression and anxiety, and Ive talked to them about microdosing for symptom relief using the substance consciously, rather than as a form of escapism. Its a healing plant for grown-ups, and for kids with epilepsy, I say. But it has negative effects on adolescent brains , so please wait to try it. Lanza told me that for cannabis to work therapeutically, it takes an alchemy of all the right factors the right time in your life, plus the right strain, method of ingestion, environment and time of day. All these factors have come together for me in my 40s, and Im a better mother because of it. Still, I dont relate to the stoner stereotype. Ive never been a wine mom, and I dont feel like a weed mom, either. Im ready to embrace a new kind of cannabis culture, free from stigma and judgment, where the plants healing benefits are studied and shared, and the medicine is available to all in need.': '291020230456.txt',\n",
       "             'at 5:47 PM Amy Goodwin removes the yellow leaves and checks for damage on the marijuana plants at SPARC in Glen Ellen, Calif. in October. (Photo by Mason Trinca for The Washington Post) Legalizing marijuana nationwide would create at least $132 billion in tax revenue and more than a million new jobs across the United States in the next decade, according to a new study. New Frontier Data, a data analytics firm focused on the cannabis industry, forecasts that if legalized on the federal level, the marijuana industry could create an entirely new tax revenue stream for the government, generating millions of dollars in sales tax and payroll deductions. When there are budget deficits and the like, everybody wants to know where is there an additional revenue stream, and one of the most logical places is to go after cannabis and cannabis taxes, said Beau Whitney, a senior economist at New Frontier Data. The analysis shows that if marijuana were fully legal in all 50 states, it would create at least a combined $131.8 billion in in federal tax revenue between 2017 and 2025. That is based on an estimated 15 percent retail sales tax, payroll tax deductions and business tax revenue. The federal government would reap $51.7 billion in sales tax from a legal marijuana market between 2017 and 2025, entirely new revenue for a business that remains illegal -- and unable to be taxed -- federally. The business tax rate for the study was calculated at 35 percent. The corporate tax rate was lowered to 21 percent in a sweeping tax bill President Trump signed last month. If cannabis businesses were legalized tomorrow and taxed as normal businesses with a standard 35 percent tax rate, cannabis businesses would infuse the U.S. economy with an additional $12.6 billion this year, said Giadha Aguirre De Carcer, the CEO of New Frontier. The study also calculates that there would be 782,000 additional jobs nationwide if cannabis were legalized today, a number that would increase to 1.1 million by 2025. That includes workers at all ends of the marijuana supply chain, from farmers to transporters to sellers. The study estimates that about 25 percent of the marijuana market will continue to be illicit, and will shrink if the legal marketplace is not overly taxed or expensive. Consumers want to do things legally in general, but they dont want to do it at too much of a price, Whitney said. If they go to 7-11 to pick up cannabis, theyre willing to pay 10 to 15 percent on top of what they get on the street. Once they get above that, it slows the transition and makes the consumer think twice about making that legal purchase. Marijuana is legal for adult recreational use in eight states. California, the worlds largest market, started its recreational sales on Jan. 1. Twenty-nine states allow the use of medical marijuana. In the three states where adult use has been legal for the longest period of time Colorado, Washington and Oregon there had been a combined total of $1.3 billion in tax receipts, according to the study. The nationwide legalization of marijuana, however, is looking unlikely under the Trump administration. While there has been a bipartisan push in Congress to both legalize marijuana nationally and protect the individual states where it is legal, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has gone after the industry. Last week Sessions made it easier for U.S. Attorneys in places where marijuana is legal to enforce federal law, rescinding Obama-era guidance that discouraged enforcement of federal marijuana law in states that legalized the drug. The decision has been pilloried by the cannabis industry, which argued that Sessions is trying to stop the momentum of a growing business and restart the war on drugs. The decision has been harshly criticized even by some Republicans. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) threatened to hold up the confirmation of Justice Department posts in response to the announcement. Sessions said hes enforcing federal law, simply directing all U.S. Attorneys to use previously established prosecutorial principles that provide them all the necessary tools to disrupt criminal organizations, tackle the growing drug crisis, and thwart violent crime across our country, Sessions said in a statement. Some in the industry believe Sessionss actions could force Congress to step in and regulate the market, or move to legalize marijuana altogether. Okay, now Congress, do something, said Morgan Paxhia, managing director at Poseidon Asset Management, which invests in marijuana businesses. Heres a chance to do something meaningful that could move the industry in a much safer direction. To some, there is no safe direction in which the marijuana industry can move. Kevin Sabet, president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, which opposes marijuana legalization, said doing so would impose significant costs on taxpayers, resulting from workplace losses, car crashes, lost tourism revenue, administrative enforcement, and a multitude of other issues. They include, Sabet said, sales to minors and increased marijuana use. We shouldnt let Big Marijuana fool us into believing their billion-dollar industry will somehow result in a net benefit for the country, Sabet said.': '291020230454.txt',\n",

       "             \"at 6:00 AM Watch more! In a Senate drug hearing in April 2016, Sessions said that 'we need grown-ups in charge in Washington to say marijuana is not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized, it ought not to be minimized, that its in fact a very real danger.' (U.S. Senate Drug Caucus) Attorney General Jeff Sessions will soon receive a report he has been waiting for. The document, from the Presidents Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety, is expected to clarify the federal governments position on marijuana and the conflicts that exist between state and federal laws. It clear what Sessions wants to do: Over the past month, he has asked Congress for permission to prosecute medical cannabis suppliers who are acting in accordance with their states laws, reauthorized civil asset forfeiture (a highly controversial practice used in drug cases), and announced his desire to start a new war on drugs. On at least one front, however, Sessionss new war on drugs is likely to fail. In taking on cannabis particularly the medical uses of cannabis heis staking out a position that is at odds with powerful interests and an overwhelming majority of Americans from nearly all walks of life. This tide is too strong to swim against. The first obstacle is that the medical community has largely resolved the question of whether cannabis is clinically useful. In January, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NAS) reported that there is conclusive evidence that cannabis (both whole plant and extracts) is clinically effective at treating some diseases, including chronic pain. Cannabis may prove to be a pain management strategy that could substitute for opioids for many desperate patients, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) acknowledges that cannabis may be an effective tool to combat the opioid crisis. Researchers studying the relationship between medical cannabis laws and opioid use have found that states with such laws have nearly a 25 percent reduction in opioid-related deaths . The contrast between opioids which killed more than 33,000 Americans in 2015 and cannabis could not be more striking. As NIDA states on its DrugFacts Marijuana Web page: There are no reports of teens or adults fatally overdosing (dying) on marijuana alone. Related: [Pot is increasingly legal. Employers need to stop screening for it.] Further, medical cannabis may also save lives in unexpected ways. Data published in the American Journal of Public Health in February suggests that laws allowing it were associated with fewer traffic fatalities. While we always have to be careful about making claims that a policy caused an outcome, evidence from multiple studies, with careful statistical analyses, is building a case that medical cannabis has real, beneficial, spillover effects. State governments are a second major hurdle for Sessions. States are sharply opposed to his moves to crack down on their cannabis policies. Eight states (with nearly one-fifth of the U.S. population) have legalized recreational cannabis use by adults. Even more striking, 29 states and the District of Columbia have approved the medical use of botanical cannabis, with 17 more having cannabis extract laws in place. This doesnt just save lives; it also saves money. In two studies, we find substantial reductions in a broad array of prescription spending for both Medicare and Medicaid in states that have medical cannabis laws in effect. Medicare and Medicaid dont cover cannabis, but it nevertheless appears to substitute for many prescription drugs that the programs do cover. Nationally, the savings could be in the billions of dollars across the two programs if all states would adopt medical cannabis laws. States benefit directly. Our work on Medicaid spending shows that they saved money as much as $98 million in the case of California in 2014 when they implemented medical cannabis laws in an environment in which the federal government took a hands-off attitude. Related: [Yes, pot should be legal. But it shouldnt be sold for a profit.] And its not just about savings: Cannabis generates substantial economic benefits as well. In 2016, Colorado saw the cannabis industry grow to about $1.3 billion in sales. Colorado levies substantial taxes on cannabis; as a consequence, it generated almost $200 million in tax revenue. Recent estimates suggest that states will collect nearly $655 million in tax revenue from cannabis sales nationwide. Not only are those direct contributions to stressed state budgets, but those taxes represent tens of thousands of jobs and the associated economic activity. At least four state governors recently wrote Sessions to ask him to let states pursue their own policies without federal interference. Because state budgets would suffer if Sessions reversed the current federal position, state attorneys general would have standing to sue the Justice Department to force Sessions to actually implement the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, which insists that a drug can be listed as Schedule I only if there is no currently accepted medical use. The January NAS report, recent revisions to the NIDA position, and literally hundreds of peer-reviewed clinical research articles make clear that cannabis has many medical uses. This, finally, could end conflicts between state medical cannabis laws and federal law: Physicians could legally prescribe cannabis and patients could get medical supervision for their care. (Of course, states would still be free to restrict access to medical cannabis if they chose to do so.) If Sessions does target cannabis as part of his new war on drugs, there is one final reason to believe the states would win and he would lose. The American people want access to medical cannabis. The most recent Quinnipiac Poll found that 94percent of Americans support medical access when directed by a physician (including 96 percent of Democrats and 90 percent of Republicans). That poll found 73percent of respondents oppose enforcing federal cannabis laws against state laws. Nearly three-quarters of the U.S. population lives in states that have legalized medical cannabis, and states have powerful incentives to preserve their laws. There is almost universal popular opinion in favor of the availability of medical cannabis. The tide has already turned.

       "             'Why is marijuana marijuana the only legal drug for adults over 21?\\nAs we approach Nov. 7, one group of Actors Against Mandatory Minimums advocates believe federal law requires states to comply with regulations to combat consumption of marijuana. Theyre getting this message from the Sons of the American Revolution.\\nDespite repeated warnings from the FBI, DEA, DEA and other law enforcement agencies that the federal government, not SAD, would enforce the law, the Brothers of the Wall stop demonstrations of youth and encourage only consumption of marijuana, the advocacy group states. So its the Sons of the American Revolution warning the federal government that the federal government will slow down and make it harder for youth to manufacture and bring marijuana back to American soil.\\nThe Sons of the American Revolution was the union representing police officers for the first time in the American civil rights movement. The 1968 Equal Rights Amendment mandates that these two institutions, which fought for womens suffrage and womens rights, obtain a federal consumption list from the Department of the Treasury, as well as receive legal recognition from these states. But only states that dont have such a list are required to submit an annual to federal law enforcement.\\nIn this day and age, alcohol also has a significant role to play. Marijuanas growth has been driven in part by recent efforts to decriminalize it. Legalization of marijuana could still be seen as advancing the federal governments cause, but instead threatens to undo much of what it has accomplished in the past 40 years. The Sons of the American Revolution finally acknowledge that the federal government hasnt taken root in much of the country.\\nBut political arguments about pot arent entirely driven by cultural differences. Marijuana is technically illegal. Under federal law, people are legal to possess it when there is a public health risk. By contrast, humans have no legal right to have marijuana in their bodies.\\nBut its not necessarily far-fetched to wonder why Americans havent embraced it far enough to protect its potential for abuse. Cannabis has significant health benefits. Medical marijuana patients often have access to other treatment options to fight cancer and weight loss. Its also marketed to a vast consumer base. So why not take this time to fight tooth and nail and get their product off the ground?\\nWhether or not Congress will come up with a definitive answer is debatable. A federal government bill is not likely to pass without testing marijuana, wrote David Goldman, president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal nonprofit based in Washington.\\nConsumers should not be scared, supporters of marijuana advocates say.\\n': '291020230459.txt',\n",

Monday nights telecast was peppered in jabs and jokes centered on pot which is legal for medical purposes in the state of California and perhaps signifies how vast the movement is gaining acceptance across the country. Cable is looking at Netflix the way Justin Bieber looks at One Direction, through a cloud of marijuana smoke, host Seth Meyers said in his opening monologue, mocking the pop princes various alleged encounters with marijuana-centric controversies. Haley Delany later praiseD her Louie TV father Louis C.K in a pre-taped video for educating her on how to properly hold a joint, while Jimmy Kimmel took aim at actor Matthew McConaughey for selling his television for a conch shell full of weed. Amy Poehler took the marijuana antics one step further by declaring that McConaughey and his True Detective co-star Woody Harrelson are menu items at most marijuana dispensaries. Singer Adam Levine also gave us a small fist pump in support of the legalization of marijuana in the United States. But it was Sarah Silvermans weed-promoting antics throughout the evening that garnered the most attention. This is my pot, my liquid pot, she enthused on the red carpet, pulling out her vaporizer pen and later insisting that her purse must-haves are a phone and pot and gum. The comedienne went on to win the award for Outstanding Writing in a Variety Special for her HBO Comedy Special Sarah Silverman: We Are Miracles, kicking off her shoes and running fiercely to the stage where she declared that were all just made of molecules and were all hurling through space right now. But the oddities didnt end there. A distracted Silverman attributed her questionable actions to feeling weird having just watched the Robin Williams tribute, and insisted that she wasnt stoned. I dont drink. I like to have a puff as a treat at appropriate times, she continued, also noting that she brought some pot-based goods for later in the evening. However, the nonsensical rhetoric was particularly evident after she was asked what her Jewish mother would think of her accepting such an award sans footwear. Well my Jewish mom wears overalls with two different color socks so I think shed go, think it was cool. But dont tell anyone Im doing this. They just hurt, the shoes just hurt, Silverman rambled. Theyre very nice. Theyre by Geppetto. I remember that because he made Pinocchio and also clearly designed shoes for the Nazi war effort. Dont be mad at me. Even when the cameras werent rolling, Silvermans potentially pot-peppered ways went on. As she left the Nokia Theater and made her way down the street to the Governors Ball, her heels still in her hand, Silverman seemed strung out about missing her purse abruptly stopping in her tracks to try and sort the matter out.

The driver, 23-year-old Brandon Joseph Dagnese, was arrested and charged with unlawful trafficking, failing to stop for a law enforcement officer, and violating bail stepping from previous drug charges. The new charges carry penalties that range from a maximum of three to five years in jail.': '241120225351.txt',\n",
       "             'Mexican-American actor Richard Anthony \"Cheech\" Marin is slamming the Arizona immigration law as little more than an attempt to hold on to white culture. Its ridiculous; its the last gasp of white culture, he told Pop Tarts at the Los Angeles launch last week of Disney Pixar\\'s online \"World of Cars.\" Reactionaries and Congress (are to blame) only because they think that\\'s the way of getting votes. We\\'ll stir up the rabble! If you take the Mexicans out of Arizona, Arizona is going to collapse the next day. But its not only the immigration law with which Marin takes issue. The \"Up in Smoke\" star would also like to see marijuana legalized. According to Marin, President Obama is doing enough to support the fight for marijuana legalization by \"not prosecuting\" those who use medical marijuana, but he\\'d like to see the president live up to his campaign of \"hope\" and devote some attention to America\\'s economic crisis. \"In (Obama\\'s) administration, I\\'d like to see marijuana legalized and I\\'d like to see him keep working to straighten out the economy, because at the end of the day, no matter how highfalutin your philosophy is, if the economy isn\\'t working, then the country isn\\'t happening,\" Marin said. Its no surprise Marin is advocating the legalization of marijuana, considering he achieved international stardom for his pot-promoting antics as one half of the \"Cheech & Chong\" comedy duo. And now that the legalization of marijuana is becoming a very real possibility, the 64-year-old is convinced everyone else shares his passion. \"Vote! Just vote, because if everyone thinks marijuana should be legalized, it\\'ll pass with flying colors,\" Marin said of Proposition 19, which would legalize the drug. Marin believes that the drug has yet to become legal across the country due to lobbying from law enforcement officials who fear that, without it being considered a criminal offense, they will be unemployed. And anyone who opposes the recreational use of his favorite herb? \"Don\\'t do it, don\\'t vote! It\\'s a democratic process, and nobody is forcing marijuana down anybody\\'s throats, and nobody is forcing beer down anybody\\'s throat, he said. They can go and have a beer or martini, so I should be able to smoke a joint if I want one. In a report authored by the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws, reliable scientific research has concluded that driving while under the influence of pot impairs vision and slows reaction time. But unlike alcohol detection, law enforcement currently lacks the technology to accurately determine offenders. And while Marin doesnt advocate driving while smoking, he says he should be able to enjoy it at home if he wants. If I want to sit home and smoke a joint and play guitar or watch TV, I should be able to do that, he said.': '241120225345.txt',\n",
       "             'President Barack Obama brushed off a question about legalizing marijuana in his online town hall last month, but guitar god Carlos Santana says he wishes he would seriously consider it. \"Legalize marijuana and take all that money and invest it in teachers and in education,\" Santana said in an interview this week. \"You will see a transformation in America.\" During his online town hall on March 26, Obama fielded a question about whether legalization of the illicit drug would help pull the nation out of recession. Obama said he didn\\'t think it was good economic policy, and also joked: \"I don\\'t know what this says about the online audience.\" But Santana said making pot legal is \"really way overdue, like the prohibition with the alcohol and stuff like that. \"I really believe that as soon as we legalize and decriminalize marijuana we can actually afford a really good governor who won\\'t keep taking money away from education and from teachers and send him back to Hollywood where he can do \\'D\\' movies and we can get an \\'A\\' governor,\" referring to former movie action hero and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger . Santana made the comments as he was promoting his upcoming rock residency in Las Vegas at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. The show debuts May 27 and runs through 2010. \"It\\'s a milestone for me because I always said I would never do certain things,\" Santana said, adding that the list included staying in one place for too long. \"Yet what is very different is this is the year I decided to do all the things that I said I would never do. It\\'s a way of coming into a room that I thought was dark and I would be afraid and I actually bring my light to it.\" Santana, whose hits vary from \"Evil Ways\" to \"Maria Maria,\" said he is also working on two upcoming albums. While the 61-year-old has previously talked about a possible retirement, he\\'s decided to be more careful about predicting the future. \"Every time I tell God my plans he cracks up, he starts laughing. So I just decided to be quiet for a while and not say that I am going to retire and go to Maui and become a minister,\" he said. \"God was cracking up. He thought it was a good joke.

Such is the case with Porsche , which is why a Miami-Dade Circuit Court judge recently approved a class action lawsuit over Porsches headlight design. Not every HID headlight stolen winds up in another car, however, as thieves in Amsterdam have recently begun harvesting xenon headlamps from Porsche Cayenne and Panamera models for a decidedly different purpose: growing marijuana. The xenon bulbs used in Porsches lighting systems coincidentally deliver a just-right blend of light and heat for budding amateur horticulturists, and they offer the side benefit of being energy-efficient, too. Nothing says grow house to the police quite like a tripling of the electric bill from month to month. As De Telegraafs AutoVisie reports, some 20 Porsche owners have had headlights stolen in the last week alone. Adding insult to injury, prying the headlight assemblies from the cars with a screw driver often results in thousands of dollars worth of additional damage on top of the cost of replacing the headlights. If you have a Porsche Panamera or Cayenne and park it outside, you may want to sleep in your car until this latest trend blows over.

Two months ago, Oklahoma and Nebraska filed a complaint with the Supreme Court, arguingthat Colorados regulations violate the U.S. Constitution. Now, Safe Streets Alliance, an anti-crime group led by a Reagan-administration veteran, is bringing forward two moresuits in federal court. Safe Streets Chairman James Wootton, who according to his Web sitebiography served in in the Reagan Justice Department, had already thrown his support behind the Oklahoma and Nebraska lawsuit this month. The president has both the moral andconstitutional obligation to stop this failed experiment by enforcing federal laws which prohibit the legalization of pot, he said at the time , while also unveiling a national petition to ask President Obama to do as much. The lawsuits echo that claim. In one, Safe Streets and Colorado property ownersPhillis Windy Hope Reilly andMichael P.

       "             'Maryland Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. yesterday became the nation\\'s first Republican governor to sign into law a measure that relaxes criminal punishment for seriously ill people who use marijuana to relieve pain and other symptoms. Ehrlich also approved a bill to reorganize the state\\'s largest health insurer, partly in response to a failed effort by the company to convert into a for-profit firm and enrich its executives. In signing those two bills, along with a measure that moves Maryland closer to giving illegal immigrants the right to obtain driver\\'s licenses, Ehrlich showed an independence that reflected his campaign to portray himself as a moderate Republican bent on reforming state government. A day earlier, by contrast, he displayed a conservative, pro-business face by vetoing a $135 million package of corporate tax increases as well as bills that would have lowered college tuition for illegal immigrants and required Home Depot and other retailers to sell more energy-efficient appliances. As he made some of the biggest policy decisions of his first year in office, Ehrlich crossed swords with politicians from liberals to Bush administration officials. On other issues, he won praise from the same groups, reinforcing his record as a lawmaker who is careful not to stray too far from the center. \"These are not easy issues, not easy bills,\" Ehrlich said of the measures he has signed and vetoed over the past two days. Taken together, he said, his decisions reflect an administration committed to bipartisan governance and \"balanced with a unique dash of independence.\" He was particularly firm in his support for the marijuana measure. It does not legalize the drug but provides that seriously ill people caught using marijuana for medical purposes cannot be jailed or be fined more than $100. The White House and some conservative supporters urged the governor to reject the bill, but Ehrlich cited his longtime support for the measure. \"If you look at my views over the years, there are clearly two wings of the party on social issues,\" he said. \"One is more conservative, and one is more libertarian. I belong to the latter, and I always have.\" The bill reorganizing CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield also sparked a heated debate. Company executives and health care lobbyists had prodded Ehrlich to reject the measure, but analysts said that would have hurt the governor politically. \"He really didn\\'t have any choice,\" said Matthew Crenson, a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University. \"If he had vetoed that, it would have given the Democrats a club to beat him over the head with.\" The bill, which gives the state more control over the insurance company by replacing almost half the board of directors and requiring that it remain a nonprofit for at least five years, prompted an immediate lawsuit from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association seeking to sever its affiliation with the company. The Maryland attorney general also filed suit to block such a move. Some Democrats were quick to seize on several of Ehrlich\\'s vetoes as political ammunition, calling him a \"hard-right\" Republican. But others said it wasn\\'t so easy to pin a political label on the governor. \"On policy, Governor Ehrlich has been pretty progressive,\" said House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel). \"He\\'s pro-choice. He\\'s open on a lot of issues. On fiscal issues, he\\'s pretty moderate.\" But Busch said Ehrlich caved in to pressure from his conservative base by vetoing the tax bill, a plan he had negotiated with legislative leaders, after 42 of 43 House Republicans voted against the package. \"It was the first indication that the party was going to drive him to the right,\" Busch said. For the most part, Ehrlich\\'s decisions this week were consistent with promises he made on the campaign trail last year, his voting record as a legislator and his public statements since he was sworn in four months ago. After lawmakers killed his proposal to legalize slot machine gambling in March, Ehrlich vowed to retaliate by rejecting higher taxes on corporations and other fees. Democrats passed a tax bill anyway, prompting his veto. \"A lot of this is pure politics, political drama at the highest levels,\" said Donald F. Norris, a professor of policy sciences at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. \"It seems to me that he\\'s drawing a line in the sand, that he\\'s telling legislators, \\'I told you what I was going to do, you didn\\'t believe me, and I went ahead and did it.\\' \" Although he had declined for weeks to say whether he would sign the medical marijuana bill, Ehrlich had supported such measures in principle during his eight years in Congress and during last year\\'s gubernatorial race. \"I don\\'t agree with him on that philosophy, but I wasn\\'t surprised,\" said Senate Minority Leader J. Lowell Stolzfus (R-Somerset), who argued vehemently against the bill. \"The Republican Party is maturing. Most people on the conservative side realize we\\'re not getting everything we want, but we\\'re satisfied.\" Critics did point out some inconsistencies in Ehrlich\\'s decisions. Although Ehrlich in recent weeks has vowed to cut $1 billion in spending next year to avoid tax increases, he allowed a 5-cent increase in the state property tax rate. And while Ehrlich has argued that Maryland has spent beyond its means in recent years, the governor picked up the budget ax only after lawmakers rejected his proposal to legalize slot machines, which would have generated $800 million a year in new funds for the state treasury. \"We can do better. The governor can do better,\" said Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Prince George\\'s). \"Thus far, his actions are wrong and off base.\" Some Democrats were already preparing a campaign to reverse some of Ehrlich\\'s vetoes. Montgomery County Executive Douglas M. Duncan (D) wrote letters to Miller and Busch yesterday, asking them to override the governor\\'s rejection of a bill that would have allowed county leaders to raise vehicle registration fees to generate money for transportation projects. Republicans, too, were not pleased with all of the governor\\'s decisions. Baltimore County GOP Chairman Donald Murphy said party activists in Ehrlich\\'s home county are \"very much opposed\" to proposals to assist illegal immigrants, including a bill the governor signed that creates a commission to explore whether the state should allow illegal immigrants to obtain driver\\'s licenses. \"We\\'re not even two years from 9/11,\" Murphy said, \"and this bill would make it easier for illegal immigrants to get valid identification.\" But other GOP leaders said few in the party had soured on the party\\'s first governor in Maryland since Spiro T. Agnew resigned 34 years ago. John Kane, chairman of the Maryland Republican Party, said Ehrlich\\'s actions underscored his appeal to Democrats and Republicans alike. \"You have to govern from the center and govern for all Marylanders,\" Kane said, \"and I think this governor knows that.\" Staff writers Matthew Mosk and Jo Becker contributed to this report.

So while U.S. cannabis firms have driven product innovation and mastered large-scale grow operations, they restlessly wait for the export curtain to lift. AD Instead Canada has emerged as the dominant exporter in the burgeoning global marijuana trade, which ArcView Market Research and BDS Analytics estimated at $14.9 billion in sales for 2019 . Companies are raising capital and building international trade ties despite Canadas unlikely climate to be an agricultural pot haven. Canada has a huge advantage because they can fill a gap, said Rezwan Khan, vice president of global corporate development for cannabis seed supplier DNA Genetics . AD Best in the World Californias growers have been developing legal marijuana products since 1996, longer than everywhere but Amsterdam. Khan describes the state as \"the epicenter of cannabis culture.\" Californias cannabis seeds have been distributed all over the world, and many foreign firms are trying to reproduce the quality of West Coast marijuana. AD The genetics and sophistication underlying the U.S. cannabis industry lead to better-quality and higher-potency flowers and innovations in oils, tinctures and edibles. The world wants that technology, said Michael Sassano, chief executive of Solaris Farms , the largest cannabis hybrid greenhouse in Nevada. The Netherlands had a big jump; they could have done anything. But the U.S. is the one that turned the industry into what it is today, with all the products we make, not Canada. AD Amazon prohibits CBD sales, but it\\'s still easy to buy on their site The other draw of American-grown cannabis, according to Denver-based cannabis law expert Bob Hoban , is that foreign customers value the regulatory oversight that ensures the product is safe and unadulterated. Its being regulated by a government agency, which is not necessarily whats happening around the rest of the world, Hoban said. AD Hampered growth But because federal law prohibits the sale and use of marijuana, growers have not had easy access to the banking system. LivWell had to pay cash for its HVAC system, and with sales limited to in-state retailers, it has not been cost effective to invest in automation for its production line. Most processing and packaging is done by hand. AD The patchwork of legalization means cannabis is not always grown where it thrives, in warm climates with limited rainfall. Its grown where its legal. California, Oregon and Colorado grow most of the countrys authorized marijuana as legally isolated islands. That leaves cold Canada as a somewhat odd choice to be the worlds leader in marijuana exports. Only 8 percent of Americans say marijuana should be completely illegal When Canada legalized marijuana in 2018, its firms could be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. So Canadian companies represent a back door for U.S. firms to access capital and export markets, and for smaller firms, a potential exit strategy. Many U.S. marijuana growers are positioning themselves as attractive acquisition targets for Canadian firms eyeing the U.S. market. AD AD Canadian firms are using their head start to sign trade deals and secure licenses to sell marijuana internationally. While the market remains limited, at least 30 countries including Mexico, Germany and Italy have legalized medical marijuana. And the numbers are growing as scientific studies have demonstrated its utility for pain control, nausea and glaucoma. Theres more than enough time for American companies to catch up, said Kris Krane , president of 4Front Ventures, which grows and sells marijuana in nine states. But the longer that we wait, the longer we continue to maintain this unsustainable prohibition, the more difficult its going to be for American companies to catch up. Ready to export AD Changing public sentiments about marijuana in the United States have many American cannabis firms readying for the day they can legally sell their products elsewhere. AD If the state borders do break open, were preparing for that, said Sassano, who also is board chairman at Somai Pharmaceutical, a holding company based in Dublin that distributes medical cannabis products to pharmacies across Europe. That means an industry that began mainly as small mom-and-pop growers and retailers must now consider its corporate hygiene and whether its meeting legal requirements to sell in these new markets. LivWell is building large-scale indoor cannabis growing rooms in Colorado and Oregon designed to scale up production for interstate or international commerce. The new rooms have 30- to 40-foot-high ceilings and state-of-the-art LED lighting cool enough to sit close to the plants. AD Then you farm vertically, said Dean Heizer, LivWells chief legal strategist. We learned that from the microgreens that people are farming in old cities and in old skyscrapers. If you can cultivate in cubic meters, you can scale. If youre cultivating in square feet, you cant. AD With 11 states plus the District approving recreational use and 33 states legalizing medical marijuana, industry insiders believe marijuana may be legalized nationally in the near future, greatly expanding its market. In November, the House Judiciary Committee passed a bill with more than 50 co-sponsors that would effectively make marijuana legal in the United States. Though unlikely to pass Congress immediately, it is seen as a sign of hope for the future. AD Its just a matter of time, Krane said. How much time is very much a question of debate.

       "             'The idea of Wall Street boom and bust should not be taken as a belated bash of sour grapes. It is a calamity, say critics and economists, whose evidence so far at the home stretch has been mixed. Many are bitterly loyal to the rotten excesses of the late 1930s and early 1940s. But still others -- loyal to the heavy betting tradition of Sorrento. On the surface, the residential mortgage-backed securities ring, which, advocates say, went down gracefully, is a sign of the subprime crisis. But the lending practices of mid- 1980s will be making their way into new forms of money, and they must be brought down. It is clear that the real estate bubble and entire economic mess is forecasted to be passed back to Washington.\\nTodays home price momentum has been horrific, but this robust economy doesnt trade a double-digit percentage gain in home values for the next several years. Nor does the 19 percent annual appreciation that has been a prerequisite for most owner-occupiers to shop the farm for tomatoes. Unemployment is on the rise, as many economists expect, and companies cannot afford to keep raising wages for their workers. And while the president has suggested that the government may begin to bail out the financial sector by putting $20 billion in reserve, the thought of billions more pouring into property banking should perhaps satisfy all the economists who believe that a bank can at least shift back to being a good investment. Instead, hes suggested that the Securities and Exchange Commission should reclassify the securities that attract illegal buyers.\\nThe best-informed observer of the weak recovery, in any case, has no trouble finding support for the program given the weather. For years, the politicians who sponsored the housing law had long been inclined to see it as an attack on the property boom, and the trend at the heart of the financial crisis might be returned to a slower pace if most property loans were reclassified as nonfraudulent. There were a couple of firefights inside the bureau in 1981. The failure of some key federal agencies never once triggered consumer fury because of arcane rules about how much outside investment money was allowed. (This controversy was forever relegated to technology-fueled analyses of human beings and computer) So how can the severity of the problem be cut back if critics insist on delegating the blame for the financial crisis to what authority they are supposed to have at the federal level?\\nTo be sure, the current findings that housing prices could be lower have nothing to do with statistical prowess. Property buying nationwide has more than doubled since 1978, up to almost 4 percent of all residential transactions -- though no home sales data exists. (The real reserve number in January was essentially unchanged from the previous month.) A lack of mortgage writing has been especially devastating to home owners, who now own only a quarter of homes. While the backhanders of the road weve been talking about before are adept at spinning through the headlines to corporate-speak about the excitement of annuity insurance, low-interest rates, and mortgage refinancing, todays owners are loath to go out and find much value.\\nSome do not think the asset bubble has been caught and its impact will dissipate very quickly. But officials say the forecast of weak home prices is really a projection of higher values. They point to encouraging research, particularly among teachers, that supports the notion that an asset bubble is not the result of falling consumer confidence. The only optimistic conclusion about the housing boom from all these reports is that it is a downbirth, especially for real estate holdings of this size.\\nThe home price report isnt pretty. But home prices have added a bit of life to the house, even as they have plunged. A reporter who examined homes in Baltimore, Washington, and the East Coast recently bought his first house. He considered a few neighbors and friends, but said he had no idea that the values of his own new home might be soaring.\\nSorrentos economists talk about a chance to influence prices like never before, on Wall Street or in the annals of government. But can the hope of that difference ever turn a decade-long tradition of elevated house prices into a trend that is inevitable? The evidence is the longer the market condition of stocks and bond markets, the stronger the effect is, especially in the years following the third wild market bust. One day, as stock and bond prices converged, this would occur.\\n': '091120113039.txt',\n",

Del. Charles A. Docter (D-Montgomery) said that \"keeping laws on the books that are not prosecuted, or are prosecuted unevenly, decreases the respect for law and order.\" Docter said \"kids disrespect\" marijuana laws much the way their grandparents ignored the prohibition of alcohol. \"A hypocrisy has set in,\" said Docter, citing reports that marijuana \"may not be as bad as alcohol.\" He said its popularity is increasing and more and more young people through their 30s are becoming \"regular instead of occasional users.\" He noted that President Ford\\'s son has admitted smoking it and one of President Carter\\'s sons was \"busted out of the Navy for using it.\" Docter\\'s resolution calls for a nine-member task force to study the \"legalization, control and distribution\" of marijuana. It met with criticism within the House Judiciary Committee today, although all of the cityzen witnesses favored it. Docter said he is \"not necessarily\" in favor of legalizing the use of marijuana but he believes the task force should study that possiblity. \"We should move, but carefully\" in that direction, Docter said. A second measure, sponsored by Sen. Clarence M. Mitchell III (D-Baltimore), would decriminalize the use of marijuana by permitting persons cited for possession of one ounce or less to post collateral of no more than $100. Similar to parking tickets, additional offenses would be treated the same way. Eight states have decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana, but Docter said reducing the penalty is a \"copout\" that doesn\\'t solve the problem of forcing users to deal with criminal pushers. It also does not permit states to set minimum standards of quality and a minimum age for users, both of which Docter favors. Del. Steven V. Sklar (D-Baltimore) said he opposes legalization or decriminalization, noting that the pressure for change is coming from people who have abused the law, \"These kids have been violating the law from the beginning. Where is the respect?\" Sklar asked. State\\'s Attorney Andrew Sonner of Montgomery County testified that existing laws are enforced unevenly. \"Many police officers confiscate the stuff but release the person,\" said Sonner, who has instructed his staff not to prosecute persons arrested for possessing small amounts of marijuana for their own use. Before adopting that policy, Sonner said the \"universal result\" of defendants who appeared in Montgomery County courts was that they were placed on probation and their criminal records later expunged.': '091120113034.txt',\n",

However, the provisions in the ballot measure arent likely to add to the costs of compliance with the new system and are unlikely to discourage people from seeking help.\\nSponsored by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Oklahoma, the statewide measure aims to decrease instances of addiction among patients by restoring \"evidence-based medical-marijuana prescriptions,\" allowing patients to simply go to the doctor if they are prescribed medical marijuana.\\nThis little piece of the medical marijuana experiment is an innovative, scientific way to help patients in Oklahoma overcome chronic pain, said Dr. Dave Bedada, director of the Oklahoma Clinical Research Center.

       "             'at 12:07 AM Theleaves of a marijuana plant inside Ultra Healths cultivation greenhouse in Bernalillo, N.M. (Susan Montoya Bryan/AP) Oklahoma voters approved a medical marijuana bill on Tuesday, making the state the 30th in the nation to permit the use of marijuana with a doctors recommendation. The measure is notable for reflecting one of the most permissive medical cannabis policies in the country. While most states specify a narrow list of medical conditions for which doctors can recommend the plant, in Oklahoma doctors will be able to recommend it for any condition. Last year the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine reviewed the evidence on medical marijuana and concluded that itis effective at reducing chronic pain in adults, as well as nausea and vomiting in cancer patients. Oklahoma patients with a medical marijuana license will be able to possess up to eight ounces of marijuana in their residences, carry up to three ounces, and grow up to 12 marijuana plants. The limits for possession and cultivation are stricter in many other states , and some states,such as New York, mandate that the drug cannot be smoked . Additionally, Oklahomas measure reduces penalties for the possession of up to 1.5 ounces of marijuana for any individual with a medical condition, regardless of whether they have a medical marijuana license. With 98 percent of precincts reporting as of 10p.m. Central time, the medical marijuana measure was leading with the support of 57 percent of voters, with 43 percent opposed. That level of support is striking for a primary election in a deep red state that voted for President Trump by a greater than a 2-to-1 margin in 2016. Members of the states Republican establishment had lined up in opposition to the measure. U.S. Sen. James Lankford recorded a TV ad urging voters to reject the measure, arguing that our families wont be better if more parents and grandparents smoke more marijuana. Gov. Mary Fallin said the measure basically allows recreational marijuana in the state of Oklahoma. Tuesdaysresults suggest that Oklahoma Republicans largely shrugged off those concerns. About 53 percent of voters cast ballots in the GOPgubernatorial primary this evening, suggesting the medical marijuana measure won over a majority-Republican electorate. Fallin said in a statement that she will be discussing with legislative leaders and state agencies our options going forward on how best to proceed with adding a medical and proper regulatory framework to make sure marijuana use is truly for valid medical illnesses.': '091120113032.txt',\n",

       "             'Agree, I usually get quite an odd look from people when I say we need to legalize more than just weed. However, they often overlook the other possibilities as to why we should legalize more than just weed. Particularly, the big two in my opinion, have nothing to do with raising money for the USFG. First, despite what the legal system actually says, the illegality establishes a stigmatization upon users that typically makes them fear seeking help or aid for their problem because they don\\'t want to face legal consequences. This is my biggest concern, because even though I personally believe all drugs are safe in moderation, as long as we keep it illegal we undermine the ability for many people to seek the help that they need or desire. Sure, it may be because of their ignorance, but we aren\\'t going around telling them \"it\\'s okay, we will help you if needed\", instead we are persecuting them to the fullest extent of the law and throwing them in prison rather than provide them with aid. Second, the reason why there is any drug violence is because of the cartels and the underground market in itself. Will it sure exist? Sure, just like the moonshining business still exists. But it will be immensely weaker than it currently is, to the point where it is hardly noticeable at all by people. Undermining the providers and producers really begins to stop the violence associated with drug use. So, why do we have drugs illegal? Because of the violence associated and to help people avoid the risk of addiction. However, I don\\'t know anyone that is going to randomly decide to become a cocaine addict just because cocaine is legal. So the argument that legalization opens access to more users is ridiculous to me. But what are we really doing? We are increasing violence and undermining the ability for many to get help. The only way to truly accomplish our goals behind the drug war is to abolish the drug war altogether.': '291220224403.txt',\n",

Along with the ease with which smokers can smoke with the biggest impact in terms of mental health. But how much are those suffering PTSD symptoms actually suffering from that?\\nOne way or another, the majority of the million plus users who use marijuana either do not experience symptoms, or they are self-medicating. And marijuana is obviously much more beneficial than some of the more potent drugs that routinely come out of the lab. Its health benefits outweigh concerns about the ease with which users partake and treat other conditions, thanks to both the impact and the practical benefits. Marijuana, quite simply, has a tremendous cognitive and psychological benefits, as do some powerful prescription medications like prescription painkillers, insulin and aspirin. We like my medicine a lot when we are prescribed the right medication and we are thoroughly prescribed the right medicine  its benefit over whats on the other side of the coin can be very interesting. Having its health benefits discussed together in print can be quite an interesting conversation piece.\\nSo my point is: any add-on to standard prescription meds that provides a proven, real-world benefits of up to 50% is a mistake, and one of the reasons why it isnt a great use of the word \"well\" is because both these problems stem from the treatment side of things, that is. Theres nothing wrong with that. Practicing this kind of hard mind over a prolonged period of time can be incredibly helpful. Whats a patient not to do? Whats a patient not to do? Simply put, if you are suffering from PTSD, a few of these warnings are you not to be \"addicted\" to this element of the body, even if it is different from the other side of the coin of antidepressants. Most practitioners will tell you that treatment is not something to be gained by having a \"medicine\" but to \"create a experience\" with that individual being \"healthy\". Thats exactly the two different forms of mental health and thats why its so important to have policies that give us options for what is sensible and being prescribed is actually how we are going to cope with these types of medical problems. By that, were establishing a consensus on what needs to be done. So its no surprise that in my view, however, people are choosing whether they should get this side of the line or not.

The best we can hope for is that for the majority of teenagers and young adults, they take their kids to the doctor and have a medical visit to get a medical marijuana supply. The presence of this aphysician, but not for recreational, could cause more delays in obtaining a drug. They also want to get drugs out of their bodies quicker than possible.\\nThis is how they price things. In 2008, the NHS bill became the \"Public Health Act\", a document that pre-empted public health procedures until today. That causes many young people to overdo their doctor\\'s visits. Indeed, public health professionals believe this is one of the greatest problems of their profession, having reached the peak of their powers at the beginning of the 20th century, when a single physician could not collect enough needles and a nurse could not help people.\\nThat\\'s why big-market outlets like the US Food and Drug Administration and Central America Drug Advocacy Agency have come together to develop recommendations on legalizing all recreational weed or anyone else. These drugs are supposed to help people by helping them live a low-impact lifestyle that helps them \"affirm, elevate and commit to themselves.\" They can make \"meaningful\" difference in people\\'s lives and can bring shame to a drug addict who might otherwise get help.\\nThis approach will hopefully lead to a healthy mainstream acceptance of recreational use.\\n': '291220224404.txt',\n",
       "             \"I think one of the issues we face when saying 'x reprehensible crime should result in people being locked away forever' is a problem of equivalency. Do you also believe that murder should result in life without parole? If not, are we as a society then saying that murder is less bad than molesting children? Insert other heinous crime and work your way through. Although it's unlikely that people who carry out such acts think them through logically, there's also an issue of deterrence of even worse crimes. If you're already potentially getting life without parole for molesting the child, why not just kill them as well? While there might be theoretical pros and cons for doing so for a criminal in that situation, you remove a potential deterrent for committing the additional crime. Another point is that the justice system is, in addition to its punitive nature, intended to function as a rehabilitation and treatment centre. If we discover that pedophilia is in some circumstances a treatable illness, what then do we say to these people? Sorry, we can fix you, but you can never come out? Or do we make allowance for the notion that they could be rehabilitated? Such a thing would not necessitate instant release - that would defeat the purpose of the punitive sentence, but could theoretically be incorporated into future parole bids. Obviously we're not there yet, but it is certainly a possible occurrence in the future. Finally I think you also have a problem with mandating sentences, or a specific sentence, for a crime. Each crime is different, in the circumstances of the accused, the impact on the victim and their family and the impact on society. Legislated mandatory sentences remove any leniency for any circumstances. To take a particularly unjust analogy; a three strikes drug law could see a person using marijuana for chronic pain jailed to the same degree as your local mid level dealer. Obviously it's not really analogous to your position, but these kind of things do happen where strict mandatory sentencing guidelines exist irrespective of circumstances.\": '291220224407.txt',\n",

Shamans have been eating mushrooms and not ruining societies for thousands of years. Drugs have good potential, you just have learned otherwise from a campaign that has motives that are NOT protection people.

It is also quite simply wrong to say they are a freedom in a society where making it into law  rather than teaching it  is actually a virtue.\\nBill Muirson, Bolton University\\nWe don't just have two kinds of cannabis per citizen  we do have the knowledge that they can grow a number of cannabis plants at home. But there are a lot of practical difficulties. For one thing, among many others the military use of marijuana has not been detected by science. It is a potentially dangerous substance which, rather than being decriminalised, is likely to have many negative effects. The Home Rule Act since 1998 has seen almost 100,000 cases dismissed, although when those cases were conducted this has now declined to only about 30,000.\\nStoryline for this\\nAfter John Robinson's Rebellion a number of years ago  he suffered heart attacks at a relative's house so they thought he would have to be allowed to eat cannabis  may well be a decent way of ending things.\\nIn the press one thing is surely clear, though: we have a very moral society and need to recognise that for all the harm and ill and evil that come with what we are doing we must not place our trust in a country led by racists.\\nPersonally, I think that many are ignoring that the struggle to legalize marijuana in this country is a lot more complicated than we are imagining. While the new law might have some problems, it still allows people to grow their own. That's a very good idea. We have a lot of small businesses in, what are, 92,000 wells in the British Isles alone but this legalisation will probably kill all those already registered businesses. There will be no revenues as a result of the new law.\\nScotland should see the cannabis law as part of an overall prohibition against human error. There has been a very strong argument for it, and not only from David Cameron, the current PM. On the other hand, earlier this year the Lords showed us something totally different than the rousing self-interest of the Puritans or our press politicians. In the hope that the new version will be seen as a battle against our own leaders, we have to bring this spirit to our new government and see how this piece of legislation could actually be fought.\\nPaul Slade, Horsham University\\nJust talking to people who grow pot, I was wondering if they would like this argument. I mean marijuana is illegal in 15 states, so I could understand why they would want to claim they know what they are doing and they shouldn't; but like I said, are they simply looking at recreational cannabis or are they just being rational?\\nI would like to know if these people have actually considered the harms associated with early decomposition as harmful to the planet, the environment and even the health of the human body.\\n\": '291220224332.txt',\n",
