The problem as I see it is that some drugs do constitute a danger to society in and of themselves. Methamphetamine can cause you to completely lose your mind. You will act in ways that you never would sober, and a nonviolent person can become violent as a result. I'm speaking from my own personal experience. I used to be a meth addict and I became totally different from the person I was before over a period of less than six months. I never had a problem with money and I was always able to buy it without any problem. But I became paranoid and dangerous. I became almost exceedingly violent and would go off at the drop of a hat. I once threw someone over my second story balcony because they said "fuck" after I told them not to. I don't remember why I told them not too, and I'm not sure it mattered. At the time I had absolutely no compunction about doing it, and I was totally unconcerned about whether or not the fall would hurt or kill them. Luckily the guy was fine other than some scrapes and bruises, but to be perfectly honest it wouldn't have mattered if I had been living on the 5th or 10th floor. Since I have cleaned up I have never been violent with anyone or been in any trouble of any kind, and it's been more than 17 years. Some drugs turn some otherwise normal people into monsters. At the very least those drugs should be illegal. Smoke all the pot you want, but there are some drugs that should not be in widespread use. There will always be gangs and shitty people doing shitty things to make money, and I'll agree that some drugs should be legalized and regulated in order to take that revenue source away from the black market and to keep people from being needlessly imprisoned, but by no means should it be all of them. Some drugs really do create crime in and of themselves.
