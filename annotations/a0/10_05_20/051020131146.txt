So reading the first quarter of so of Scalia's piece and the blog, it seems their (the majority's) main rationale hinges on that they believe that California's marijuana market (in this case) interferes with federal regulations of interstate commerce (illegal drug trade). The question to me is whether this interference is really substantial enough to warrant such a potential expansion of powers of the Commerce Clause. I think the reality is that creating a legal medical marijuana market *does* have an impact on the marijuana supply in other states as well. It creates a legal market for a previously illegal good within California. However, this good is easily transferable to out of state (it's not like marijuana expires; and if a medical marijuana license was as easy to obtain as it is today, then the restrictions wouldn't prevent out of staters from getting a license). As such, to me it seems understandable at face value that SCOTUS would be concerned about an over extension of a state's ability to impact out of state markets through such a legalization. Furthermore, since the time of the ruling, what qualifies as interstate commerce has only become more complicated with the advances in technology which have taken place which make it even easier to order goods from out of state. Does the ruling open a potential pandora's box of extending federal government power over the commerce clause? The way that the majority opinions seem to state it, it doesn't necessarily. They leave it rather vague, and seem to only validate such a ruling for a case dealing with specific markets such as illegal substances.
