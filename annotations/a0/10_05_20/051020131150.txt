Hmm, the sugar argument I find pretty persuasive. While its tempting to say we can just ban sugar, or go back to my position on cigarettes/ alcohol, I suppose the only decent justification for the continuing legality of sugar is its relative proximity to being neccesary or unharmed up in our society. It could be possible (though heavily unlikely) that cheap, sugary foods are the only way some impoverished Alaskan people survive. I dont think such a fringe case is easily attributable to recreational marijuana. It could be fairly argued that the main issue regarding sugar is the fast food industry, but even if such an argument could be made, it would be pretty diluted at best. Your point for #4, on the other hand, I feel is contradictory with the sugar argument. If marijuana were to be legalized, you say, the average quality of marijuana sold would go up. But clearly, fast food companies are not selling high quality foods that include sugar. Similarly, the explosion in demand for marijuana after its legalization would likely cause a few shifty producers to make marijuana as cheap as possible. This kind of leads into #5, where a sudden increase in opportunity leads to shady practices. Im not defending McDs or coke as good companies, just that two wrongs dont make a right, and limiting the amount of invasive corporation is probably a good thing. Im convinced at least that it wouldnt be that bad, or at least not as bad as sugar is already, but Im not 100 percent on the justification that we do bad things already, so why not do more, not as bad things?
