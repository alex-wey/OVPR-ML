Youre way overstating it. As I said in my original response to you, youre being hyperbolic. You have a major issue with something that normal people dont, and, like most immature people, you lash out at them, you externalize it, instead of owning it as your problem.> That does not mean that society doesn't have an issue. An issue that you would not give two fucks about it you didnt have severe anxiety even being around alcohol. > Society should change for itself. Don't be so disingenuous. Do you not know how transparent youre being here? Do you really think anyone reading this would believe that was your real concern?> Poison. A substance that attacks your brain and can easily kill you. More exaggeration. Is that what youre worried about? Really? Do you know how much alcohol it would take to kill you? Easily or otherwise? Orders of magnitude more than what your average person drinks in any given situation. But thats not the issue. You cant even be around a person having a glass of wine, right? > Your hypothetical of a person who is afraid of dogs is a straight up fallacy and I can't even begin to address it. Its literally the exact same thing.> Why is alcohol legal while marijuana is not? Why is ecstasy and LSD outlawed? Just because society tells us it is okay, does not mean that it is. More faux concern. You know the answers to those questions.> We had slavery as long as we had alcohol. Total non sequitur. Alcohol isnt going anywhere. You can either get help for your debilitating anxiety, or continue to anonymously lash out on Reddit, at those who have no problems with alcohol. Your choice.
