Logically you're correct that, no, there is no inherent contradiction between the two positions, but what's notable about the two positions is that particular principles automatically fail because they contradict at least one of the two positions. This is similar to the potential opposite view, being Pro Choice but also Anti Death Penalty. For the first one, you can't hold the principle "Killing another human being is only morally permissible in self defense", because the Death Penalty is not an act of self defense. Similarly, you can't hold the principle if you're pro-choice and anti-death penalty as abortion is not an act of self defense. (You could get around this though by defining a fetus as not a human being, but you do run into the issue of defining human being more clearly) For example, if I gave you the political positions of "I am in favor of legalizing marijuana" and "I am in favor of increasing foreign aid", there isn't generally an issue. Any principle that would support legalizing marijuana will not usually come into conflict with a position regarding foreign aid. But with an issue like Pro-Life vs Pro-Choice and regarding the death penalty, both involve issues of human life directly being killed, so any principles that support one must not come into conflict with the other, or else you risk acting in contradiction to your own beliefs. They may not be contradictory, but they these ideas are in conflict with which principles will allow both.
