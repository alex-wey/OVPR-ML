For the record, "synthetic cannabinoids" are rarely actually cannabinoids. The issue with "legal smoke" or "incense" is that far too often you have NO idea what's in there. There have been a host of medical problems associated with the drugs ranging from nervous system disorders, seizures, heart problems, joint problems, ect. Many of the varieties have been shown to cause physical dependency and overdose is not only possible, but easy. I'm in an area where they're use has become extremely common, especially among plant workers nearby. I've had many friends use and (struggle to) quit the drug for various health reasons (seizures, long term numbness in extremities, chest pain... all real reasons I've had friends quit). I've also had some personal experience that I won't get in to because it was brief personal experience. I quit immediately after my first bad "trip". Not that I agree with the charges against you at all. That's total and utter bullshit. You can't be held responsible for the actions of your superiors. What I'm saying though is that I take exception to calling these drugs "synthetic cannabinoids" because that really gussies up the nature of these drugs, and indicates a huge part of the reason kids are so easily roped into trying these *dangerous hard drugs*. Kids are sold on this bullshit "it's just like pot man, it's not dangerous, it's just a synthetic pot substitute that can't show up on a piss test" which is how I got roped into that crap.
