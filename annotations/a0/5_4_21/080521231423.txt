Thanks for your response I think you have a very interesting perspective! In your first paragraph you stated that the abandonment of sobriety is un-virtuous behavior and undermines all the previous things which make a person virtuous. How does that come about? I think that belief is widely accepted in our current society but if we look at other societies we can see that's not always the case. For example many Native American tribes promoted the use of psychedelics and marijuana for religious purposes. The philosopher Michel Montaigne argued that the pleasures that we get from excessive drinking are so rewarding that we should refuse no occasion nor omit any opportunity of drinking, and always have it in our minds (Essays, Of Drunkenness). By definition caffeine is a mind altering drug but it is still widely accepted to use it everyday. I can't see how the use of caffeine would make a person un-virtuous. Also your argument stated that some drugs such as LSD are different from other drugs such as alcohol because you cant responsibly ration out a determined amount of the drug and know how it will affect you. However for pretty much any drug you can ration out a predetermined amount just like you can alcohol. For example if some didn't want to go into a full trip on lsd they could take a .25-.5 mg dose and just get a euphoric feeling. Also for your last point I understand the legality issues I'm more focused on the morality of drug use however.
