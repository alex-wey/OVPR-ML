You do realize that that fault is on your friend making an idiotic choice, not the weed right? I dont know anyone who drives while high and most of my friends smoke, as do I. Besides, making it illegal wouldnt stop people from driving while high. You are blaming something on what basically came down to personality responsibility and choice. Weed doesnt make you think hmm driving while high is a good idea! that was your friend. The FDA has straight up said weed is safer than Tylenol, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, etc. its the safest substance you can possibly take. It has a ton of medical use (even if its just symptom suppression.) I can understand your pain, I really do. My stepdad died in a drunk driving accident. But I dont blame the alcohol. He had a drinking problem and thought he could do anything, went too fast, pin popped off on his 3 wheeler and he died. Life is too short to stop people from trying things that makes their life better. I consider caffeine and weed one of my small vices that helps me get through my day, it doesnt cause any harm, there is no logical reason to dislike it so much. I hope you can move on from the trauma of losing your friend, but that was definitely not the weed that caused him to act like that. that was a poor decision on his half, people shouldnt be punished because of people like your friend. Edit: downvoted for truth lol. Weed doesnt make a high person make decisions totally different than they would while sober. If he thought driving high was a good idea, he would think it was a good idea while sober. Blaming weed is like saying Im not myself, I had caffeine today!
