I've been undergoing interferon treatment for stage III melanoma since January. Now given, I smoked pot before I got cancer, so it's not like this is news to me, but it sure has helped me deal with both the physical and mental pain my diagnosis has provided. Interferon isn't chemo per say, but the side effects are still pretty damn miserable. I quit smoking everything about 11 weeks ago (I used to smoke cigs too), but I still vaporize marijuana throughout the day to help me with the pain and overall craptastic feeling my treatment causes me. I would highly recommend it, pun intended. :) It's not gonna work for everyone, and if she hasn't smoked before it can be a bit... interesting at first, but personally I find it to be a lifesaver. Too bad I live in a state (Texas) where not only is pot not legal, if I do ever get caught, I can't even tell the jury I'm using it at a doctor's recommendation for my cancer. What a fucking crock. Not to mention it can be a bitch to score sometimes. Sorry to get political, but this is my life here, and could very well be yours as well. TL;DR: Pot has personally helped immensely with my ongoing cancer treatment.
