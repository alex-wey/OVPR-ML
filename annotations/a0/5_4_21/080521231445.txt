I'm sick of the pro-weed culture in general. It's the new Ritalin! Go smoke a joint and all your problems go away, go use this hemp oil to fix that. And I live in a place that is LEGAL to possess, smoke, and even with the right permits, grow your own weed. Let's just face it, most of the use is recreational, even the people claiming to do it for other reasons. The problem is, for it to be legalized, for any use, not just medical, it takes this stupid amount of sensationalism like it's the best thing ever to progress the legalization by making it look like there's this huge demand for it. But the truth is most people are smart enough to see that it's like running a snake oil campaign for Tylenol! Oh wow, you can de-stress, put 10 years on your life, and do such because you take Ibuprofen! When it's just a pain killer, that's all it does, kills pain, stimulates appetite, gives euphoria. Sure there may be unknown advantages and disadvantages, and even some known ones, but for the most part, I'm tired of hearing how weed fixes everything because it does not and never will. Nothing fixes everything for everyone.
