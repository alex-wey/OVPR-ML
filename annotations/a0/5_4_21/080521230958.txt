* well for drug interactions there is pretty much only anecdotal evidence to go on because it's hard to grow and maintain a stable sample of cannabis (with a consistent cannabinoid profile) in countries where it is illegal (that includes the Netherlands) to get good empirical data. scientists still don't know just exactly how any of the other cannabinoids work or interact with thc. but the majority of the anecdotal evidence is that it is unlikely there will be a bad interaction.* if she has smoked tobacco then she would probably be able to easily handle a joint or bowl. the pungent aroma of weed may still take some adjustment. if she hasn't you should try a method of cooling the smoke down before inhalation to minimize the alien sensation. vaporizing into a plastic bag is the best option although costly. bongs work nicely too, some people say the water can filter out some of the canabinoids resulting in a reduced effect. however you can simply use refigerated stones to cool the smoke in a bong. otherwise a fairly massive bowl takes a lot of the heat out the smoke too. * if its schwag (poor/mediocre quality weed) she probably wouldn't be able to smoke too much. if it's good weed. take it a few minutes in between hits and see how it goes, she should be fine.* the best course of action is to find a friend who: *is cool*, and *knows a guy* to smoke with her the first time.* other things you should consider include your mom might like it, a lot. like she might get kinda depressed about how she never had weed before, or she might just go and become a pothead. also your mom having always been a good girl may not be accustomed to being bad and the secretive behavior habits that must be adopted when engaging in illicit activity, she might upon discovering the harmlessness of weed act as though everyone else has had a similar revelation and get herself in trouble.
