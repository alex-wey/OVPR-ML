I agree with some of your points and disagree with others.1. I don't have much input on this2. Cannabis has a lot of unwanted effects when it comes to analgesia. A therapeutic drug aims to target the issue and cause very little changes in other areas. On that front, weed is horrible. Weed seriously impairs REM sleep, is psychoactive and can therefore affect the patient at work, while driving, etc... It affects the reward pathway and those effects are not well understood especially on people with mental disorders. Can have detrimental effects n kids, fetuses(?), etc... All in all, it has mediocre analgesic properties with a ton of other effects. Could it be favorable for certain people with certain treatment resistant pain disorders? Maybe, but those would be rare occasions that require a prescription rather than legalization.3. Again, psychosis isn't the only risk. Science has little understanding of psychiatric conditions and cannabis can play a big role in modulating them. Is it worse than alcohol and tobacco? Definitely, is this a sufficient reason to legalize something. Not really.4. Yes, it should be legalized but controlled. It should not be made available to the public, but anyone with a habit should be able to speak to a doctor and get supplied for example. That is until more research is done to understand the psychiatric effects it has.&#x200B;My main issue with cannabis advocators is that the health claims are always exaggerated. Sure, it might help treat 100 different conditions. Is it the most therapeutic approach? Most often not.
