There's a perfectly good marijuana XXX, go on there and moan about drugs being legalised. It gets rather tedious after a while, it is never going to happen! Certainly not in the forseeable future. Why should it? Just because you enjoy it? Because there's still no evidence to support either case that it fucks you up or not? I've seen some pretty fucked up individuals on weed and when they give it up they're magically cured and able to get jobs. The majority of the argument from what I've seen on XXX is based around "But alcohol does worse and that's legal you never see pot heads punching people in the street". You're just being little playground snitches. What if tomorrow they ban booze too, will that make you happier? The tax, the tax! Who cares about the tax, next you'll be telling me that legalising weed will cure the economy. If the one policy you care about is legalising pot I think you need to have a long look at yourself and your ideals. YAY I can get wasted with my friends now. How about worrying about some important issues like letting people have same sex marriages, fixing the economy, fixing unemployment, healthcare. Man that list is endless Oh but wait I don't smoke weed and I've dissed it so cue the backlash. Edit to add, I'm very aware of the if someone says cue the backlash or equivalent they don't get it but I don't care. It seems on Reddit if you are anti pot you don't get to be part of the gang
