I feel like these aren't strong points to make for legalization. To me the most important aspect of the way our society handles this issue, is the fact that adults care too much what other adults do to their own bodies. It's just as ridiculous as grown men and women minding about where other people put their genitals. Another thing that seems insane to me is that if the state thinks that one harms his own body, the way to help the user is to cage him. It's 2014 and we still have such an ignorant and primitive way to discuss drugs. We don't even use the word drug consistently since we love some drugs which happen to be deadly. We need to popularize studies that show the real effects of cannabis on the human body and we need to teach people more about the substance. This plant is all over the planet, there is absolutely no way to get rid of it, so as long as substances like weed, psilocybin mushrooms and LSD are around, we should learn to live among them. Inform the people about it's dangers, treat excessive use as a health issue, not a criminal one.
