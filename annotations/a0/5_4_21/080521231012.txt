Now, it's not as difficult as he sounds to think about legalising marijuana (and there's some evidence to back that up)
Jim Carrey has spoken out strongly in favour of legalizing marijuana  and that includes sending a file to the director of Provence.
But you wouldn't think otherwise? Well, now he's become the "moderator" of weed to general public: It's nothing that most of the talkheads in the world don't understand.
In fact, the 60-year-old actor took to the stage at Durban University last week and took issue with any notion that it should still be illegal.
"I think it's much more dangerous than I was 10 years ago," he said. "There's old adage that the best way to get rid of cocaine in jail is to hunt and kill people. But I don't think it's appropriate for a human to think that taking a pot away in prison  drug enforcement should always be a health issue."
The British actor was also the topic of a debate at South Africa's Cape Town University, where he advised against legalization.
"I honestly don't think that marijuana can be effectively treated as [a] public health issue," he said. "I know this is a hugely popular topic in South Africa, but I have seen it with similar trauma."
Is he the only one voicing concern for the legalization of marijuana, or will the powerful states who are considering legalization become the butt of many British jokes?
