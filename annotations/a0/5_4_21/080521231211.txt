Coming from a conservative in a very conservative state- YES! The money being allocated trying to fight this crime is ridiculous. If weed was legalized and taxed it would create much needed revenue for our government while at the same time eliminating the cost trying to fight it. The cost of regulating it would then be covered by the tax and would not be an issue. Most figures I've seen also show that legalizing marijuana actually has a curbing effect on its use anyway, so I personally do not believe it to cause a pandemic of blazed up idiots. My view of the current marijuana legality parallels that to the American prohibition of the early 1900's in that many people do it, and it is only creating crime for the reason that it is illegal. If its a problem of being a gateway drug they should outlaw tobacco products all together. Edit:Having said that, I don't smoke weed and have never found myself with a need for it in my own life. Not looking down on those who do, I really couldn't care less, I have just never found the need. I do however look down on those who let it consume their lives in the same way that we look down on alcoholics and that one douche that talks about "how much they drink all the time and get stupid drunk." That shit is obnoxious.
