It all depends on how much legalization the UK has achieved
I have been smoking cannabis since I was in university, years ago, not realizing that I had just been arrested for possession of cannabis, but slowly it's helping me relax, relax. As a result, I now use meth as well as other drugs, such as ketamine and heroin, and I love it like nothing else I've ever smoked before. When I think of policing illegal drugs, I realise there are dangerous forces trying to bring them down.
I have seen too many incidents in my past, from drunken individuals going to jail on legal drug charges (guns, live ammunition, crazy knives, even petrol bombs) and endangering life, to the type of police they don't want us to be, the result of a breakdown in trust in what we police do, especially following the Grenfell attack. As more and more ministers, pro-life MPs and public health figures have also been caught up in the bizarre wave of marijuana legalization, the use of medical cannabis is considered illegal in the UK.
Can cannabis do the same as medicine or the prescription of cannabis oil?
I have never believed in the use of cannabis. On a regular basis I'd open up to cannabis specialists and give them the green light and go on to use it for various recreational and medical purposes. I've never seen such a strong public demand. It is the power of the cannabis community that pushes governments to turn away from illegal use and change their laws.
As a cannabis expert who teaches at Johns Hopkins University, I used to imagine cannabis being abused, abused, abused and illegal, giving us nightmares. Even though they are usually only given to people with limited uses, sometimes sold in stores in homes, they can be helpful for other drugs, or worse. I remember once getting a call from a homeopath who admitted to carrying cannabis for almost five years. Unfortunately I did not cure him, but he was a supportive person.
