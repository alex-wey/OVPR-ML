1. To the people who want to now outlaw saturated fat, chocolate, soda, candy, popcorn, red meat, chese, etc. WTF ARE YOU GOING TO EAT WHEN YOU'RE BAKED?2. Gupta raises several good points, which proponents of legalization seem to overlook. A) Smoking anything, including marijuana is bad for your lungs. (oh, what about tobacco? yeah, see any recent legislation allowing people to smoke in more places?) B) Marijuana can be psychologically and even physically addictive, contradictory to the middle school presumption that it's not. C) Marijuana actually affects users in different ways. Just because it calms you and make you giddy, doesn't mean that it doesn't make the next guy over paranoid and hyper-stressed. For some it even increases the perception of pain. So the age old argument of "no one ever beat their wife on weed" doesn't really hold water. Not everyone becomes a lazy, giggly, dipshit.3. People used to smoke tobacco with no additives because that's all that existed. Major corporations started selling packaged tobacco for smoking. Major corporations added chemicals and additional addictive properties to a natural substance (already addictive, but they made it worse). Major corporations profited off of the weakness they created in millions. Do you really wanna smoke R. J. Reynolds weed?
