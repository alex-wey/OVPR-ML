The people in power are always going to be productive people, that's why they are in power. As such, they value productivity, and want a society that reflects that value. Weed doesn't promote productivity (or at least the sort that the people on the top value), and that's why it's illegal. That's also why caffeine is absurdly over-accepted (it's literally a drug that we put in the food that we give to children). I'm all for weed (like, seriously, if it was up to me, we'd take caffeine out of soda and replace it with THC), but I don't think all the thoughts it leads to are always totally accurate ones, and I think there is a danger to overly positive thinking.>especially if you start thinking about how to stop racism. How the government keeps that shit under wraps because they need to give you a distraction, you know, something to keep you from thinking about THEMI do agree that a lot of why racism exists is because of the government. However, I don't think they are creating it out of nothing. I think they are manipulating things that are actually part of human nature, to magnify and refocus our natural tendency to have biases. Essentially "us vs them" is just baked into our psychology, but if they place us in groups, then we'll see other normal citizens as "them," or "the enemy" when really we should be seeing the government and those in power as the enemy.
