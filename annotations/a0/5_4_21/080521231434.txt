You don't *need* a car to go over 30mph. Lowering the speed would surely save lives, but its fun to drive faster, and I want to get to work 10 minutes sooner. You don't *need* to have processed snacks, sugary foods like ice cream, candy, or cakes, but that would save billions of dollars on the healthcare system and lower death by heart disease, diabetes, or other complications from obesity. But they taste **Great**You don't *need* to smoke marijuana or drink beer. But we like to change our states of consciousness. Marijuana is currently illegal in most states but people are pushing for reform. Alcohol is tied to thousands of deaths a year (throw in cigarettes too), but we tolerate it because its **fun**. I'm sure you could think of hundreds of other examples. The takeaway is we live in a society that values freedom and personal choice, even with incidental risk to yourself, others directly, or society as a whole (think healthcare cost, increased taxes, chance of accident or death). In all of those examples we don't even get to the question of whether you *need* anything if you wanted to justify why we do them, and those aren't even enumerated rights. The purpose or utility of the freedom for all of the examples I listed is either recreation, vice, or enhanced taste; and the risk includes substantial economic cost to society as a whole and even death of yourself and others.
