Hollywood star Corey Feldman has spoken publicly about an apparent altercation on the Internet involving marijuana.
The actor tells XXX in an upcoming interview that hes undergoing a procedure to remove some of the marijuana from his body.
Im in it again, Feldman says. For somebody to say that at a time like this, I just wish I could lock myself up and not let them have anything to say about me.
A further statement from Feldman on Wednesday sent to XXX says his doctor has diagnosed him with a medical condition.
My doctor has referred me to the help-desk for certain findings, as well as other proactive matters related to prior meds and complications, Feldman said. I feel that I am within my rights to engage in the treatment that has been recommended by my doctor.
Feldman also insisted that his body has never been consumed with drugs.
It was no mistake, I thought. I thought. Its all about human beings, Feldman said. They never, ever could have. That wasnt how it was delivered. They were out of sync with the human body.
Feldman, a relatively young actor, filed for bankruptcy in 2006, citing bankruptcy following an arrest in 2006 that charged him with marijuana possession. A plea deal had been reached that allowed him to repay his debt to the child in case he ever again violated the terms of his probation.
I understand that this is an all-or-nothing situation, Feldman said of the legal situations surrounding his recent arrest. I understand my life has taken a huge turn for the worse.
One could argue that Feldman is suffering from a growing addiction to marijuana and would love to recover his body to help the heath.
Im very grateful and have been greatly aided by the medical advances that Ive made in the last few years, Feldman said. I want to thank my doctors for the tremendous response and treatment that they have given me.
