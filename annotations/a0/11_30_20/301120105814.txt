Oliver Stone on Friday opened up about a debate he was having over the practice of illegal drugs on Jimmy Kimmel Live.
While discussing his Live podcast Fire And Fury, Stone said that when President Bush used marijuana during the 1960s he knew exactly what he was talking about: Its worse than slavery.
The former FBI Director and journalist recently opened up about Godless Slavery, and the movement that led to the death of Rodney King, calling the action indiscriminate. As Stone put it, King was one of the real violent men that did not get killed by alcohol.
Stone emphasized that everything Bill Clinton did during his Presidency was illegal because it represented free riders which meant anyone who performed a dirty job  like destroying synagogues  was not serving and was being punished.
It was like Hitler, the immigrant in the ghetto is somebody you know, theyre like mad. Theyre not whipping people. We made that country illegal for people to get paid to go out, Stone said.
Stone says he never heard himself preach righteousness or quackery, but he wishes he could preach righteousness in the bedroom under the guise of being a boss.
I love these human beings like the history books say, but is the way they live live real good? Just go walk on the sidewalk, dont run over people, dont take drugs, dont take crack, Stone said. We should turn our drugs into good people.
Stone raised the idea that the illegal use of cocaine may amount to terrorist stings and said that he thinks the largest tax loopholes available today are related to the amnesty program, an idea that echoed Stones bigoted words of criticism of President Barack Obama.
