When Frank Ocean performed at Fridays Dave Matthews Music Festival, he was confronted with the wave of creativity that greeted the New York City event and a less-than-enthusiastic response.
Most people thought that he would be out in the festival, or close to it, the evening of it.
Soon after the hour-long show, he hit a chord as a whole, with an anonymous 29-year-old youthbander getting arrested for alleged drug use. And it still did that as part of the Radiohead songs singles Seann William Scott and No Love from the 1985 album Winding Down, and later Superfast by the Bjork-Australian pair of Limp Bizkit.
Apparently I was arrested by police last night and they posted some evidence on the web, he said, noting that word of the incident was picked up at police headquarters. The next day I got married, and I still havent found out whether Im married or not yet.
His response?
I believe my music will grow. I believe its the future for everybody, and I still believe its the best music in the world. Im still painting; Im still trying to make the best album that I can in my career. If anybody wants to record me again, thats fine, Im in the studio somewhere.
The intense reaction came during the encore, and when he watched the discussion on the big screen via social media, he couldnt help but comment on the whole thing.
I was like, I think it was the first time in my life I went out and got arrested. I feel very confident.
