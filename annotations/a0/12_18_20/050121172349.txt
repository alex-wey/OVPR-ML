Frank Ocean in an insouciant tweet Thursday night, three days after he was cited for speeding and possessing marijuana in Californias Sierra Nevada. The Mono County Sheriffs Department told AP they caught the 25-year-old R&B singer-of-the-moment New Years Eve in his BMW going 90 in a 65 and found a small bag of weed as well. Since theyd stopped him doing the same speed a day earlier, they took his license this time. Strangely, for all the stars Twitter candor, his actual publicist declined comment.
