Doug Fines recent piece, Five myths about legalizing marijuana, which promotes the legalization of the drug, received a lot of attention. In his column, Fine states five common-sensical assertions regarding marijuana use in our country that he wishes werent true, labels them as myths, and presto, concludes that legalizing weed will actually help solve a lot of problems. Oh, really? Call me old-fashioned, but also call me realistic. Advocates of legalizing marijuana are making this debate harder than it has to be. Simply put: What current problems of ours might be solved if we had more inebriated people wandering among us? The first thing pot promoters want us to do is deny the obvious, as if we are all stoned. They want us to believe that the known consequences associated with being on the loose with degraded senses in an open society would simply not occur or at the very least, would not increase if marijuana use were to become more widespread. In Fines case, myth number one is that, If pot is legal, more people will use it. To rebut that statement, Fine cites something or another about drug use in Portugal between the years 2002 and 2006. Im not kidding, this is the best theyve got. I dont know what it is about modern life in Portugal that we should seek to emulate or why Portuguese drug use should serve as a model for drug use in the United States. But, you get my point. Read Fines piece. Anyway, this is an issue where Republicans should be clear and speak with one voice. At a base level, our politics should seek to promote a more sober, safe and virtuous society, and nothing about making pot use more widespread than it already is serves the common interest. I can hear the left rolling their eyes at this quaint notion. We should not think we can appeal to a segment of voters particularly young voters by embracing destructive misbehavior as desirable public policy.
