If California voters decide to legalize pot, a group that advocates for legalization in Colorado and Washington State will face a litmus test.
Members of a legal marijuana industry that advocates for legalization in Colorado and Washington State will get a chance to present their case to the Colorado and Washington State Legislature on Tuesday when they hold an attempt to use the legislation, known as Amendment 64, to qualify as a business-friendly law. The group had a keep it legal stance when the money raised from marijuana sales was added to the pot budget. But since Colorado residents paid only a fraction of a penny for the drug, backers like the Marijuana Policy Project are starting to count the cost of keeping the pot income tax rate flat.
Without some political support, all kinds of medical and recreational operations in Colorado and Washington State will be forced to leave Denver, Colorado Springs, and Gaston to the mountains for Colorado and Washington State, just like sales tax-exempt types of businesses in the U.S. currently do, explains Media Matters for America legal director Stephanie Russell.
