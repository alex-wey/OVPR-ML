Young white men like Carlos Santana are adopting marijuana as a legal weed.
The singer has been on the "Dirtball" front  that is, a country-music banger they generally remember their childhoods in  for the past year to help President Obama.
Saturday, Santana will appear at the 2011 Art Walk for Change, a S.F. townwide community event that aims to broaden understanding of legalizing marijuana.
"I'm going to talk about me as a life-long weed smoker and how I use marijuana to make a living," Santana said via GQ. "I grew up in California and smoking weed in a pool."
Santana drew heavy attention in 2011, when he became the one of the city's 10 most talked about figures when he was arrested for driving under the influence in New York City.
Santana now rests in legal limbo, according to TMZ.com. The site has obtained his travel documents and is leaning toward certifying his presence as a citizen of the United States. The singer said he wasn't involved in the police sting that produced the indictment.
But the problem now is that once Santana passes his driving test, he'll have to wait to be reinstated as a U.S. citizen. This puts him in a bind, as it allows him to choose a lawyer rather than actually run with it.
As for the band, Santana is on stage this Saturday alongside rocker Ghostface Killah, Stray Cat, Mariah Carey, and even a narrator, Mark Hamill.
Unlike Davis and Hoodie Rock, who are responsible for big-name artists like Jim James, Santana sees the same dichotomy between politics and music as he sees in science.
"It's a different planet," he said. "I love the idea of humanity continuing to move forward and hope for the best."
