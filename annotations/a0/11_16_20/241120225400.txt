A California judge wants to stop a marijuana campaign in California and Hawaii for relaxation and recreational marijuana use, the Huffington Post reported.
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Sharon Kleinberg held a public hearing on the attorney-client privilege issue during which she reviewed Culpos current medical marijuana plan to benefit from a friendly regulatory system.
Kleinberg also told Culpo that her marijuana-advocacy organization would file a public comments contest.
The attorney-client privilege allows the counsel to discuss matters that are critical to its legal goals and interests.
It takes people years to be brought together and you dont just say, OK, the attorneys going to be representing, Kleinberg said.
Culpo, who said she is well-versed in ethics, worries that cannabis control could alienate people from her employer, NBC reported.
A doctor in California told CNBC on Thursday, however, that even Trumps recent campaign against Congress proposed ban on the federal governments use of medical marijuana could affect childrens mental health.
Pot pot is a solution to the problem that we have, Los Angeles City Councilman Bernard Parks told NBC. I dont know of any thing thats going to make me happier about how it addresses mental health problems in the childrens health.
The head of the pot-producing business community has said the prospect of marijuana legalization would make Chicago new hip city and create new jobs for residents.
Chicago has a bevy of healthcare providers, a bunch of utilities and large companies in the city, said Kirk Jowers, CEO of the Chicago Treatment Centers. They are huge in everything we do.
Culpos proposed amendment would allow medical marijuana use by minors.
Chances are that Culpos plan wont pass the California Assembly.
