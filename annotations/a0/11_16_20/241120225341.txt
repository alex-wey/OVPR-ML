One the biggest stars in the world, Brad Pitt has been nominated for Oscars and has a gorgeous partner and six kids. But in the '90s, he nearly puffed away all his good fortune. "I got really sick of myself at the end of the 1990s: I was hiding out from the celebrity thing; I was smoking way too much dope; I was sitting on the couch and just turning into a doughnut; and I really got irritated with myself," the 48-year-old actor tells The Hollywood Reporter. "I got to: 'What's the point? I know better than this.'" After a life-changing trip to Casablanca, Morocco , "where I saw poverty to an extreme I had never witnessed before," Pitt quit smoking weed. "I just quit. I stopped grass then -- I mean, pretty much -- and decided to get off the couch," he tells the magazine. Today, the father of six is happily committed to his partner of seven years, Angelina Jolie , and -- stop the presses -- he may even marry her. "It seems to mean more and more to our kids. We made this declaration some time ago that we weren't going to do it till everyone can. But I don't think we'll be able to hold out. It means so much to my kids, and they ask a lot. And it means something to me, too, to make that kind of commitment." "We haven't closed the book on it. There's a really nice balance in the house right now, but if we see the need and get that lightning bolt that says, 'We can help this person; we could do something here,' then absolutely," he says. Pitt may be clean and sober now, but his stoner past got us wondering: From Pitt to Courtney Love to Winona Ryder , which '90s star came out on top and who burned out?
