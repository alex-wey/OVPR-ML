Seth Rogen may play a mall cop in his new movie, but malls weren't his primary hang-out when he was a kid. "I was more of a smoking weed behind the 7-Eleven guy," Rogen told Tuesday at the premiere of "Observe and Report." "So yeah, didnt go to the mall much." Rogen's very glad he chose acting over a career in mall security. "[Being a mall cop] is not the greatest job in the world I think," he said. "They get a lot of disrespect." Co-star Ana Faris concurred. "They just dont have enough power," she said. "I was a patrol crossing guard in elementary school, man. I loved it. I loved the power." Faris, who plays a makeup counter girl in the movie, the object of Rogen's affection, has fond memories of mall life. "Ahhhh, Orange Julius," she opined. "We also had Glamour Shots. I could never afford to go get my glamour shots done. But we would always walk past it, my girlfriends and I, just dreaming [about getting] our glamour shots done one day." Co-star Ray Liotta's mall memories were not so rosy. "I was driving my moms car. I was on vacation from college. I took it to a mall. I came out, and it was gone. Someone stole it. Thats my mall story."
