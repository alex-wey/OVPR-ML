Does marijuana only make it into production?
The primary cause of infertility?
Yes.
There are several things one can go by from a healthy application of marijuana to a functioning body for the average drug user, using a significant amount of medical marijuana, or not. Marijuana is legal in five states and the District of Columbia, and legal it in Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Nevada, Alaska, Utah, and Washington state. The ingredients of pot include the psychoactive compound tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in cannabis oil and in cokes or hot dogs, and the active cannabinoid norepinephrine, an energy-producing chemical.
But what about the other side of this coin? According to Marijuana Business Daily, a cannabis-based cosmetic company, which will be releasing its next recreational product, or products for that matter, will come pre-traced through a compounding process, which essentially allows pot buyers to extract the compound using the same procedures prescribed in the drug.
The only problem is marijuana is legally produced in a federally controlled facility, and will be consumed only with a marijuana-based product. Which means pot possession is subject to the same strict and strict regulations as any other substance. Then, youre charged a tenfold tax on both marijuana- and marijuana-based products.
