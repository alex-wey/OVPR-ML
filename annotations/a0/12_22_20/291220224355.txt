But you aren't being objective here. You are still making a subjective judgment based on notions defined by your cultural experience. Calling people "suppressed" or "mistreated" shows that you are being subjective, because other people literally do not see what they are doing as "mistreating". When you judge a murderer in a court of law, you are only being objective within the constraints of the law, and analysing a case as it relates to the laws in place. *The laws themselves are based on subjective ideologies.*Example: Let's say a guy gets arrested for having a lot of weed. It's illegal to possess marijuana, and you're a judge. You disagree with the law, but because you are a judge, you have to "remain objective" and sentence the guy based on the evidence that he has a giant bag of weed. Is the judge really being objective? Only in the context of "obeying the law."I tried to get at this in another comment, but are you saying that we are all "bound" to a universal law that falls in line with your concept of morality? That's the only possible way that everyone in the world could "objectively" say that female circumcision/outlawing homosexuality/etc are "wrong". We would need to be constrained by a set of undeniable principles to adhere to. And I would argue that no such thing actually exists.
