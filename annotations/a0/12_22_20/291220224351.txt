Most of these are totally different points, though. If you wanted to argue "I think legalization of pot is bad, CMV", you could have done that, and it would be a completely different debate. Instead, you went with a title that basically insinuates that legalization advocates are either addicts or dealers. I think that specific argument has been disproven, and you've acknowledged as much (even here, 'substance abuse' is very different from 'addiction'; most college kids abuse alcohol at some point, but only a small percent are alcoholics). The benefits vs costs of marijuana, pot subculture, health effects, etc. have nothing to do with the stated topic of this CMV, which is a presumption about the nature of advocates. The one thing you do say that is relevant ("most people who smoke are involved in a lifestyle that revolves around it") requires some pretty strong statistical support to back up and actually flies in the face of stated evidence (the number of people who support legalization is dramatically higher than the number of people who are regularly involved in the stoner lifestyle.)I'm not trying to convince you that you should support legalization, because that's not what this CMV is about (and that is a much, much more difficult point to argue). I'm trying to convince you that by assuming legalization advocates are either addicts or dealers, you're making a huge and measurably false presumption. Nothing more, nothing less.
