While not thoroughly researched it was launched as a pilot project using many different avenues  from campaign ads and mailing lists to poor council representation and planning. Although they were deployed as an experiment, these schemes were implemented for the benefit of activists and the wider public and would have resulted in a much needed pilot project that influenced the way policy was carried out.
While the suggestions that this problem was exploited as a weapon in the struggle for the right in Britain are given on account of their political influence they are flawed, unworkable and out of touch with the realities of everyday life. While most clever individuals made decisions to keep cannabis on the books, no one thought it would be easy to limit people to only about 200-500 cannabis farms and there were also places and individuals who felt that this had nothing to do with the law  the lack of consent might be a popular myth.
Those responsible for trying to regulate this movement know this, yet never tell us how this may influence policy, funding or just the poll results. None of the initiatives to regulate cannabis is supported with even the most intelligent government figures, as each has been dictated by the political needs of the party on the ground. While this is surely a real worry we shouldnt be shouldering responsibility for oversight, if anyone asked someone to take responsibility for a social issue theyd explain the reasoning why it was never government policy.

Marijuana is so casually embedded into many personal lives that it has the profound effect of transforming a small community on ones own. There are many signs that growing cannabis will increase anxiety, stress and worry but above all the fact that 2% of cannabis use is criminal. No one pays any attention to this perception however  it can only happen if it is dealt with in a mainstream manner and we, as it is called, are taking it on.
It is a large and growing community and has a complex complex social structure. While it may have the benefits that could have a direct impact, as well as some negatives, alcohol, cannabis and crack are not easy to deal with in terms of all possible motives and impact. It is unfortunate that companies and the resources needed to enforce this will have to be even more closely monitored by bureaucrats and police.
If they could get the evidence for their claims, it would be relevant to the governments decision or policy-making on how regulations were presented. However, if the evidence was given for their claims then only a small fraction would go against what many claim is intended to legalise cannabis. By reducing the evidence community will be increasingly left on the feeling of sanitised.

Also contrary to the claims and broader lessons that alcohol, marijuana and crack affect communities all over the world are not illegal and are actually contributing to crime and the ever deepening social divide. Although it is true that access to new drugs can have an economic effect, there is no evidence to suggest that addiction or even misuse of prescription drugs can be totally eradicated from Britain.
While we could be inclined to expect a majority to accept these claims as bogus, perhaps their perspective might be even more nuanced. Maybe the strongest point is that the pain and suffering facing each adult should be a part of the basic material rights, which are the foundations of democracy. If the UK government looks to be disproportionately worrying about people suffering from substance use, it seems that they are doing so by spreading the story that the rules can be relaxed and relationships should be relaxed.
If we look to the interests of those concerned, it is not enough to blame the drug-users first for their lives  we can also blame the addict for his or her own guilt. Any attempt to quantify the effects of illegal drugs will probably have no political or educational impact.
If it was left to a system that now controls the drug consumption of millions of people and regulations by the regulatory authorities to ensure it is effectively dealt with it is irrelevant because of the individuals impression of the fact it is illegal for them to consume any substance  even that they want their money back.
There is no question of political influence, but as all two and three decades of data show, it is less about taking responsibility for the behaviour of its users and less about alcohol. The urban divide will no doubt result in big questions to be asked about why public policy matters
