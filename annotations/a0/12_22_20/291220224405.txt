Can I throw my thoughts in here? Thanks guys. I enjoy GJ's stance on medical Cannabis. But almost everything else, I don't agree with. So it's hard to vote for a man who I disagree with 9/10 times. But let's look at BO from another point. He has called for a few DEA raids on dispensaries, yes, this is true. But this is an election year, and he is more concerned with getting reelected. So if he knows that he needs to call for a few raids, and not push for decriminalization in order to gain a few moderate Repub voters, or swing voters (not sure of the exact term here); he's going to do that. Long story short, I think he's taking it easy. No use shooting himself in the foot. Now let's look at the next four years, supposing BO wins. He cannot be reelected, so I think there's a MUCH bigger chance for him to go along with decrim measures, and legalization issues. He's younger, he was a smoker, and he knows people care about the issue. The man isn't dumb, he knows how popular legalization is. But in his first term, and in an election year, he won't risk losing it by implementing those things. Let's get BO back in office for another 4 years, and see if we can get something out of him. With less pressure to get back in office, I would be EXTREMELY surprised if he didn't take the first major steps towards decriminalization or legalization. He has a better shot of winning than Johnson, and Obama seems to be ahead of Romney. Also, don't be dumb stoners. Go out and vote. I just got my application for absentee ballet while at school. I hope others follow through as well.:)
