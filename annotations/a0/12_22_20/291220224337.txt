I'm becoming more and more of the opinion that we need to start shifting back to states' rights. I say this as someone who is on the far left when it comes to economic and social issues, and it still feels kind of weird on its way out. The way I've started looking at it is this though, making certain issues into national talking points when they don't have to be keeps things practically at a stalemate. I'm willing to let folks here in my home state of Alabama run shit a little bit more backwards around here if it means that true reform can happen in other states and act as a tangible good example. As it stands, truly reformist ideas can't get any sort of foothold. With California and possibly a few other states bringing the legalization of marijuana up for consideration this year, I think we stand to see states' rights become a more accepted position among progressives. It will have to be, considering what will happen will basically be legislative revolt. Beyond returning more sovereignty to the states, I also think the people on the far left and the far right have another common interest. Proportional representation in each state and at the the federal level. I see the Tea Partiers as the American equivalent of the BNP. I don't like their ideology one bit, but I think both of our camps could make more gains if that sort of reform was made. You would, I think, see a broad enough spectrum of moderates take seats to keep things balanced though.
