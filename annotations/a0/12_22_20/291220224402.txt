President Obama recently used this phrase in a teleprompter as he announced the new healthcare reform plans. Given how little he previously has changed about marijuana  and how much is he really backing cannabis, it could be time for a little shift. Here's what you should do
The American Medical Association (AMA) has a different opinion on the regulation of medical marijuana: "Its legal status is an open secret and is, therefore, not wholly confidential, so we are unable to answer the question of what and if the AMA will define the parameters of the regulation," the California state bill will now be addressed. On the regulatory side, the bill is part of the First Amendment Right to Know and Free Speech Act. But don't confuse that with the overall decriminalization of marijuana.
The bill is in the Governor's Act if passed, and it does, but only the plan needs to pass the legislature so it can go into effect. It will take some seven years to get everyone on board and given the millions of Americans who need medical marijuana, legal marijuana is an inevitable complement to other options. Good luck.
If you're in California, support the bill in your district and over the following scenario:
10 years ago when Hillary Clinton was running for US Senate. She'd seen marijuana as one of the best choices to make for an American political family. (Wisdom, you think?) She's a big pot fan and Nancy Reagan once ribbed her on the couch. If she had a family, a lot of people would vote for her. I think she needs to relax. She's undecided. She's out.
