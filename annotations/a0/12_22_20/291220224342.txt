Those who believe that weed is good for you are asking for attention from the FDA, as it can make you grow more rapidly
The burgeoning cigarette market is a big part of the global economy, but one thing to watch out for is whats happening with the EU. For many years theyve been the bastion of legality, keeping a distance from the mainstream, particularly in the UK where I work. Research done on a European profile by Harris Poll published last year showed that the Public HealthWatch approach of Why smoking? programmes in just the beginning could affect countries that dont work with the FDA  even after controlling for tax policies and local regulations.
The other big issue is where is it going? Where is it going with its current products. The US was the first country to actually decriminalise it, and part of the conversation around cannabis had to do with how effective it would be. Americas public schools are still concerned about the drug use on school sports, which has led them to place the emphasis on addressing these issues diplomatically.
Not as obvious to many people is that the EU has made it more difficult to get laws passed, since the 2012 Brexit referendum result highlighted the imbalance in the priorities on where to focus. As politicians pushed for an independence referendum that didnt necessarily hand them much political latitude, it became increasingly hard to get one: there was widespread anxiety among the British electorate that any immigration referendum could become anti-democratic  the real issue, according to Damian Drum, a senior EU diplomat, was that immigration policy was not balanced enough.
