What view do you want to change? If you want us to change your view, "I despise pro-Marijuana advocates.", I can't help you. You're 100% justified in despising the individual who told you that smoking would have cured your Dad. I also don't doubt that you've met other vocal idiots. ~~Whether these individuals represent the movement as a whole is your subjective judgement.~~ I don't believe these individuals are representative of people who support legalization in general, but I know they exist because I've met them too. Whether you like or despise the movement as a whole is your subjective opinion and I can't help you with that.>I don't want evidence that the drug itself is good, but I am looking for some reason why I should vote to let such people get what they want. I would invite you to learn about cannabis itself: it's potential for addiction or lack thereof, it's application to medicine (very limited but real), and the social and economic effects of legalization as opposed to prohibition. This, rather than the character of the activists, will inform how you vote. *I think that by going down this road you will also find more rational people advocating legalization too.*Editted for clarity.
