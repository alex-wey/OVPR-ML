If it was not for William Randolf Hurst and DuPont pumping millions of their dollars, to save their own outdated investments, into criminalization of a plant which would have revolutionized how goods were made. Marijuana and hemp would have never been criminalized and we wouldn't have half the problems we have today. Some of those problems include deforestation, the death of American farms, the pollution of our rivers and lands with the chemicals necessary to break down the fiber in wood into pulp, the high costs (environmental, military and economic) of oil based goods such as plastic and nylon thread clothing, the high cost of the production of soy bean based ethanol and the costs associated with housing an inmate population of non violent offenders. The same tactics of fear, hate and racism the Bush administration and so far the current administration have used to strip the average citizen of most every right we once possessed were used to strip us of our right to a better alternative source of medicine, relaxation, bio-fuel, paper, plastic and numerous other products that's invention may never occur or has been delayed.
