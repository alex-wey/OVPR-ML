Any medical marijuana activist can tell you that most conservatives love to sideline the debate on medical marijuana... bringing up the availability of drugs like marinol, the larger "slippery slope" argument of what federal medical marijuana legalization will do ("We'll then have to legalize marijuana for everybody! Then we'll have to legalize all drugs! Then all of our children will become raging dope addicts!" etc) so in order to cut short that argument before it can even start, I wouldn't be surprised if this man was only saying that to keep the conversation focus on the issue of medicinal legalization in the very short space of time that he had. And given the ambiguity of his statement, who is to say he doesn't feel it should be illegal for children but not consented adults? Have you spoken with him directly?> I certainly would rather see people like him (although not him in particular) be able to use whatever medication they need to relieve their symptoms before I'd like to see legalization. Somebody *may* not agree exactly with you on *part* of marijuana policy, so you think it's okay for them to spend the rest of their life in agonizing pain?
