Although to be clear I do agree that we should decriminalize marijuana, or at the very least make it a slap on the wrist regardless of quantity. The vast majority of marijuana arrests are not targeted operations against marijuana, they are usually connected with some other crime or reported incident, or something like a traffic stop.. and the majority of charges are misdemeanors. Felony arrests are almost always for distribution or trafficking. To expand on my meaning, my sister in-law works for the DAs office in a district in MO. She explained to me that they almost never target for marijuana distribution anymore, but instead marijuana is an almost given added charge because almost every drug distributer is going to sell it. So they'll raid a house for meth or heroine, and then there is almost always going to be a substantial enough amount of marijuana that they can tack on additional felony charges. When you look at trafficked drugs seized by law enforcement, Meth leads the pack.
