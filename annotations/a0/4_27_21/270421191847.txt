I think what we're currently seeing is the two forces rushing together in a manic fervor of tolerance vs. intolerance. Anti-smokers have been around for ages, same as the pro-legalization crowd. As prisons are being overfilled with people whose only crime was carrying some marijuana with them, the legalization folks started getting louder. Lumping cigarettes and weed together... because, c'mon, smoking anything is bad... The anti-smokers followed suit and got even louder. Back and forth, both sides trying to outshout each other. This will build and build and build until it finds a societal balance. My two cents? Relax marijuana laws, and allow further research into its medicinal properties, while still moderately regulating and legally restricting it in the same fashion as cigarettes and/or alcohol (including considering any negative health issues it may cause; to yourself, or to those around you). Social reasoning shifts somewhat like tectonic plates would. They crash into each other with tremendous force, but slowly. There are earth shattering events, constant tension and enormous pressure. Both sides always gain ground onto the other. Then, bit by bit, they form into a conjoined landscape for a while before shifting again.
