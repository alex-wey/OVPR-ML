New high in support for legalizing marijuana Fully 50 percent of Americans say the use of marijuana should be legal according to a Gallup poll released Tuesday, the highest in polls since 1969, when just 12 percent favored legalization. Almost as many, 46 percent say marijuana should remain against the law, but that number has softened over the past decade, down from more than seven in 10 in the mid-1990s. Liberals and those under age 30 are the strongest supporters of legalizing marijuana, while support is lowest among conservatives and those over age 65. Cain, Romney close in South Carolina and Florida Presidential candidates Herman Cain and Mitt Romney are in a close fight for support in Republican primaries in South Carolina and Florida, according to two new NBC/Marist polls . Cain stands at 31 percent to Romneys 28 in South Carolina among likely GOP voters (the difference is not statistically significant). In Florida, Cain and Romney stand at 32 and 33 percent, respectively (including those who lean toward a candidate). Texas Gov. Rick Perry places a distant third in both states with about 10 percent support; other candidates are in single digits. Blame government or Wall Street for economy?
