So reading the first quarter of so of Scalia's piece and the blog, it seems their (the majority's) main rationale hinges on that they believe that California's marijuana market (in this case) interferes with federal regulations of interstate commerce (illegal drug trade). The question to me is whether this interference is really substantial enough to warrant such a potential expansion of powers of the Commerce Clause. I think the reality is that creating a legal medical marijuana market *does* have an impact on the marijuana supply in other states as well. It creates a legal market for a previously illegal good within California. However, this good is easily transferable to out of state (it's not like marijuana expires; and if a medical marijuana license was as easy to obtain as it is today, then the restrictions wouldn't prevent out of staters from getting a license). As such, to me it seems understandable at face value that SCOTUS would be concerned about an over extension of a state's ability to impact out of state markets through such a legalization.
