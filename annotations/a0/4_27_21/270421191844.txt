Things to include: Why it is illegal: History behind how it first became illegal. How the timber/oil/plastics industries wanted it illegal because hemp was their competition. Also Harry J. Anslinger. A racist who was able to convince everyone that mexicans and blacks go crazy when they smoke marijuana. Medical Benefits: It has countless medical benefits including but not limited to insomnia, appetite stimulation, treating AIDS wasting syndrome, the effects of chemotherapy, MS, chronic pain, and there is even some evidence that it shrinks tumors (although the jury is still out on this on) Organizations including the American Medical Association and the American Cancer Society have acknowledged that marijuana does have some health benefits. Effects on the Body: You have been lied to your whole life. Marijuana does not give you schizophrenia (although if you have genetic predisposition you have to be careful) it does not give you cancer, it doesn't give you brain damage. There are zero deaths every year because of marijuana. There is some damage to lungs, but any time you inhale burning plant matter this will happen. The effects can be reduced by filtering with water, or almost completely removed by vaporizing.
