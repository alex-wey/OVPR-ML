U.S. prosecutors in Colorado started a crackdown against nearly two dozen medical marijuana dispensaries located within 1,000 feet of schools, giving the proprietors 45 days to cease operations or face civil and criminal penalties. U.S. Attorney John Walsh issued the ultimatum in letters to 23 dispensaries and landlords he said were in violation of federal and state law, a statement Thursday from the U.S. Justice Department said. The move makes Colorado the latest battleground pitting federal prosecutors against storefront distributors of marijuana in states that have decriminalized marijuana for medical purposes. "When the voters of Colorado passed the limited medical marijuana amendment in 2000, they could not have anticipated that their vote would be used to justify large marijuana stores located within blocks of our schools," Walsh said. He cited a 2011 memo from U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole that allows individual federal prosecutors to "exercise their discretion to handle marijuana trafficking matters." The Colorado move followed an announcement in October by federal prosecutors in California that they were cracking down on medical pot dispensaries they said were fronts for large-scale, for-profit drug trafficking.
