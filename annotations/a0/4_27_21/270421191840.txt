States can be "[laboratories of democracy]()," places where we try out new and crazy laws to see what works and what doesn't. It's a lot easier to convince the federal government that there will be no problem legalizing marijuana if you have a track record that it has worked in five different states and counting. If you tried to launch this at the federal level, first of all it would never pass, and second there's the fact that IF there were problems involved in a new policy, then only the states that implemented it would be "ruined." Marriage equality is another good example of this; of course in retrospect (and even at the time), of course there wouldn't be any problems with SSM. But legal SSM had a decade-plus of solid evidence of its being a good thing, which undoubtedly influenced SCOTUS when Obergefell came to trial. Also, moving states to get access to laws you like isn't really that hard if you're talking about the Northeastern states or a person who lives on a state border. Fireworks were illegal in the state I grew up in, so everyone drove twenty minutes to get fireworks in the next state over.
