James Pastman was arrested this morning in Chicagos Far North Side after police found that he had been growing marijuana in his home. The legal trouble gets worse for Pastman, 50: his apartment is right above a preschool. A dog barking out an open window in the building attracted officers attention. Given the cold temperatures, they decided to check on the dogs owner. When they entered the building, they immediately detected an overwhelming odor of ganja. They knocked on Pastmans door, who admitted that hed been growing pot and allowed the officers to enter his home and seize his (apparently quite elaborate) irrigation, lighting and ventilation systems, as well as a number of cannabis plants. Pastman has been charged with felony manufacturing and delivery within 1,000 feet of a school, which means his crime is automatically a Class 1 felony, according to Illinois marijuana statutes.
