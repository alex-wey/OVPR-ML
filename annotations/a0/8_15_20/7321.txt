Drugs being illegal holds back research that could be done on them.How do you think most street drugs started? A lot, maybe all, of street drugs started out as medical application drugs but were taken out of use because they were too addictive and/or harmful. No research needs to be done on them. We know them well. The reason why street drugs have a reputation for unpredictability is because cheap-ass drug manufacturers cut random shit into their product.  Drugs being legal would make it easy for drug addicts to seek medical help without fear of arrest.There are already ways for addicts to seek treatment without criminal charges. The government actually *wants* to help you get off drugs.  he/she is going to use the more dangerous drug because of an inability to access the safer oneI think that would happen regardless of whether someones usual drug is legal or not.Your point is a valid one and commonly discussed. Weed is being legalized in a few places (I don't live in one and it may take a while to see the effects). Personally I think the only advantage to legalizing illicit drugs is to get revenue by taxing them. That's what they do with cigarettes, which is shit because cigarettes are so bad for peoples health.edit: spelling
