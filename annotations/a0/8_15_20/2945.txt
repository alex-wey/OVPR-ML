They Are Against Equal Rights For All Humans and Their Arguments Are TerribleThere's one party in the US that insists everyone should be treated equally regardless of race, color, or gender. THe other party is the democratic party, which insists that the government do favors for some races and genders but not others. Why do you think the former party is against equality?  They Want the United States to Essentially Be a Christian Theocracy....Now I may be biased since I'm an secularist, Yes, you are. They Are Pro-WarThe Obama administration has started more wars and spent more money on war than the bush administration. So I think when you said "this is obvious", what you meant to say was this is obviously wrong.  They Are Overly Nationalistic, a Trait That Has Proven Deadly Throughout HistorySays the man who thinks people should be proud of their race, sexual orientation, or any number of other arbitrary categories. Pot, this is kettle.... They Are Against Renewable Energy and Their Disbelief in Climate Change is Insane and Shouldn't Be Tolerated At This PointCan't even accurately articulate the arguments conservatives make against climate change, how on earth do you know that they are wrong? They're Pro-Big Business and Pro-Big-Lobbying, Essentially Turning the United States Into An OligarchyOnce again, we must turn to barack obama, the [money-rasingest](https://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/indexp_indiv.php?cycle=2012&id=N00009638) presidential candidate in history twice running. Or hillary clinton, who plans to [literally double](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/hillary-clinton-fundraising-goal-2-billion-118183) Obama's previous record. there's definitely big money in american politics, but it's backing democrats, not republicans.  They Want to Tax the Rich Less and Tax the Poor and Middle-Class Moreonce again, your facts are simply inaccurate. The bush tax cuts made the tax code more progressive, not less. MarijuanaTraditionally, liberals are pro-marijuana and conservatives are against it.Democratic vice president is a proud drug warrior, as is most of his party. Prohibition was a progressive effort from the start. progressives are most certainly not traditionally pro-pot, or any other drug.  Conservatives seem to love locking people up and spending trillions on prisons.no, they love locking up criminals. Do you prefer to let them keep committing crimes? In addition, any reasonable human being should be against private for-profit prisonsThat's a reasonable position, as long as you're also against [for-profit prison guard unions.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/23/police-unions_n_6373380.html) Otherwise you're just a giant hypocrite.
