I'm so sick of people saying it's should be legal to smoke weed, weed is bad! it's not fucking healthy in anyway, the research that shows it doesn't do much bad to you is done on people well into adulthood, and those people generally are not tested for very long, and their brains are developed, so those research of course don't show many negative results because weed does damage to your brain that isn't as bad as when you use heroin that fucks you badly up instantly, now on the other hand, research on young people is the one that is showing the bad results, that are true i.e possibility of hindering or disrupting cognitive function and plenty of other bad stuff, basically if you're an adult it doesn't do that much bad to you but still can do bad stuff to you, it's very dangerous to young kid's brains and their development. Look weed should be allowed for dying cancer patient and other people who feel awful and just want to enjoy their last living moments peacefully, but how can you possibly justify legalizing weed when it has already shown that it does horrible damage to young peoples brains and i'm not talking about teens, peoples brains aren't fully developed until 25! and has bad effects on adults too? And to those who use alcohol death rates as a comparison, that doesn't make any fucking sense either!? alcohol is literal poison, it kills far more yes but that's because the effects of marijuana do not show as prominent as alcohol but it still does damage to your body and why try to justify that with the rates of poison that's only legal because of it's history and it's just common in todays culture. I know this was all over the place, but what I'm trying to get across is that weed is bad for you and statistics don't tell you the whole story because of the age range those researches are made on, but I sure as hell wouldn't want my future kids to be in a world where weed is easily reachable, but of course terminally ill people should have the chance to enjoy their last few living moments happy.
