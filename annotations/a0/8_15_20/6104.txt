That's interesting. Just to give you some (perhaps overly personal) background, about half the males in my family have a single psychotic episode around the time they turn twenty with no clear environmental cause. When I had mine, despite knowing my family history and having a negative drug test for everything but marijuana, the psych hospital told my parents I had "almost definitely" smoked weed laced with PCP, which was "the problem with dangerous street drugs". That's all just to say that I'm super-sensitive about saying someone caused their own mental health problems, because, even from family members who had experienced the same condition, I had to listen to them tell me it was my fault for the months it took me to recover my normal patterns of thought.That article certainly makes more of a case than I've seen elsewhere, but I'm not sure I find it convincing. Here's the paragraph where they differentiate correlation/causation: Of course, association does not prove causation. However, one by one, alternative explanations have gradually been disproved.4 Patients do not start using cannabis to self-medicate their psychotic or prodromal symptoms or side-effects of drugs, but rather use it for the same reasons as the rest of the population, principally for its ‘high’. The risk of psychosis remains after controlling for personality disorder and use of other psychotogenic drugs. Some overlap between genes carrying susceptibility to schizophrenia and to drug use has been reported but insufficient to explain more than a fraction of the relationship.4This argument seems to based on self-reported motivations, controlling for diagnosed personality disorders, and controlling for other drug use. I'm not sure the fact that people express the desire to get high says much about why they're taking a substance, and I think there's a much broader range of "sub-optimal" mental states (that might lead one to self-medicate) than are regularly diagnosed. If they wanted to claim we knew there was still a correlation after controlling for, e.g., Borderline Personality Disorder that'd be one thing, but it seems like a stretch to say ruling that sort of thing out proves causation.edit: extraneous comma
