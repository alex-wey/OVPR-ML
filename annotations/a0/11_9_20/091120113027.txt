A Lancaster County dispensary and several similar businesses filed with the District for approval Wednesday, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously for the dispensaries  and never said what it called the results.
Jokery Co-owner Dean Talley was one of three pharmacists working for the dispensary, making a lump sum payment from a $4.5 million tax-free pot, and hes excited. But the partnership hes working with expires in 2014. He said this is the first time the three dispensaries he works for have met the same standards, and its not the first time theyve met.
Its very disappointing, he said. Its going to hurt the medical profession. If you get approved, youre about to lose our job.
Still, Talley isnt exactly scared.
Were operating out of a small hotel, and its affordable. And thats the reason were hopeful that well get the approval, he said. Its frustrating not to have anything in front of me. Im ready to run if they approve it.
