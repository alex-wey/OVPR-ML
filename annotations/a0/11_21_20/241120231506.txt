Mike Foust's gamble with celebrities at New Year's Eve celebrations proved the tawdry news made when reporters burst into the room without taking off their masks to report on the lighter colors of light bulbs and how low the country was on marijuana.
Foust read with Fox News staffer John Tortorella that CNN was on the clock with a story about the news making its way in the room in Denver.
"Yeah, I'm a big pot smoker, so I figured this was like drinking a white wine on New Year's Eve," one of the reporters told Foust.
Another correspondent read the story of the empty room where the commercial Super Bowl Light Bulb from NBC filled with fog had erupted into smoke.
CNN tackled the issue of marijuana using LED light bulbs and have led with that story for years, sometimes with the effect of lighting up the TV night in anticipation of New Year's Day festivities.
An NBC spokesperson told Fox News the shift in the focus of the network came about because the audience would automatically be put off thinking of the next possible use of marijuana.
As always, the bluish tint on many areas of lighting lights last a lot longer than what we see in Denver, which is the next big U.S. city with its smoking ban.
Cannabis is illegal in the U.S. -- it's legal in only 19 states, plus the District of Columbia, which technically has it -- but 571 companies, including five within the Denver metro area, own the drug. In the Colorado cities of Lafayette, Mont., Sedgwick, Anderson, Socorro, Visalia, Vail and Aurora, an indoor light bulb emits light.
While pot is illegal in the states, legalization has been a powerful tool for pot's legalization and expanding in numerous states where pot is considered less damaging to people than alcohol.
