Its apparently a high-flying party in the USA whenever Miley Cyrus is around! Cyrus stunned well-wishers at her 19th-birthday party, happily telling them shes a pot-loving stoner. You know youre a stoner when your friends make you a Bob Marley cake, said the Hannah Montana star during her the bash last week at Hollywood s Roosevelt Hotel. You know you smoke way too much f--king weed! she exclaims on footage from the birthday bash obtained and first aired yesterday by the iPad newspaper The Daily. But her rep insisted "It's all been taken out of context." In an interview with Us Weekly, her rep said "The cake was a joke and Miley's response was intended to be sarcastic." Cyrus, who turned 19 Wednesday, caught heat last year when video emerged of her using a bong to inhale what she claimed was salvia, the controversial but legal hallucinogenic herb. The singers pal and party host, Kelly Osbourne , was standing next to the birthday gal when she made her unexpected pot proclamation. Osbourne laughed and chirped: I thought salvia was your problem!
