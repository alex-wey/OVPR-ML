A Minnie Marley named Bob Marley's daughter has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of growing marijuana in her home.
David Marley pleaded guilty to drug possession and was ordered to serve a year in jail and pay a $600 fine.
The plea came three days after Bob Marley's cousin, Angela Keith, pleaded guilty to charges of misdemeanor marijuana possession, according to court documents.
Keith also was charged with felony possession of an illegal chemical by a minor, according to the documents.
The charges stem from the alleged drug fight between the two women who live in the Bel Air section of Baltimore. According to court documents, four adults watched as someone picked up a joint with Marley's oldest son, Shawn, and threw a paint gun.
Keith could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted of second-degree marijuana possession.
Marley, who was born Eliza Irvine McNerney, was a well-known artist and artist during his massive career as a singer and musician. He became well-known as a tireless advocate for the rights of the poor.
In 1995, Bob Marley spent 25 days in jail for beating his older son for a marijuana possession arrest, according to the Bel Air Times. He was jailed on $50,000 bail.
Marley was also incarcerated for his involvement in a drug dispute in Ohio earlier this year.
Last month, the former president of the United Nations, Laureate of a Women's Diploma and Mediator issued a public apology to Marley for his drug use in the future.
