Snoop Dogg flirted with using marijuana during a performance on Monday at BMI's after party for the BMI artists awards at Cali nightclub.
As part of the BMI awards for songwriting, the hip-hop star dedicated a song, "Do It For Me" by his brother Chance the Rapper, to his mother's late mother, Patsy, who died in 2009.
The rapper said he considered marijuana "for the sake of my mom. It doesn't matter what her needs are."
The BMI awards are the largest representation of New York music designers, songwriters and record companies.
Rapper Pitbull accepted the artists' award for songwriter of the year with his manager, Ricky Ricketts. Pitbull walked away with six awards.
