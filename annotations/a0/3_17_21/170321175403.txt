A new Gallup poll found that 64% of Americans support federalism when it comes to marijuana laws, saying the federal government should not enforce federal laws against marijuana in states such as Colorado and Washington that recently voted to legalize marijuana use. Even 40% of Americans who are personally against the legalization of marijuana were in favor of federalism. The Federal Controlled Substances Act prohibits marijuana use, and state laws such as those in Washington and Colorado are in conflict with it. According to the poll, 60% of Americans aged 18 to 29 support legalizing marijuana while about as many of those 65 and older are opposed. The bulk of middle-aged Americans those aged 30 to 64 are split on the issue. Among Republicans, 66% believe marijuana should be legalized while 33% support legalization. Democrats favor legalization, with 61% in support and 38% opposed to legalization. Independents are split, with 50% supporting legalization and 47% in opposition. Fifty percent of Americans believe marijuana should not be legal while 48% believe it should be.
