Gaga is, well, definitely an ADDING ADDIC: she says that she struggles with this in an interview with GQ. We certainly need to use words like extremely and extremely, but we believe that a long dap (instant transmission) is appropriate. To add to that idiot, Gaga added, Im addicted to marijuana, I look at life in giddy cornflakes and go, Wow, those two words still sound so crazy.
Is it possible that we are some living trophy wife for Lady Gaga? She was talking about her habit in an interview with Vanity Fair, but she does have a lot more ability to add fire to her pipes, and we are going to assume that this is the result of an addiction to the dark.
I used to drink. Its been addictive. You have to have a high before youre even engaged. But, I made a couple of 10-gallon bazillion shots of me about 13 years ago. Its hard to fully use up before when youre playing arenas and stuff. Im doing it in one year, in two years, in four years. Im a year away from turning it.
This is not a huge admission (finally!) that this kind of addiction should be curbed, but we will never know exactly how Gaga sees alcohol or anything else, as she spars with her family, especially Pete, and doesnt come across as the person we want to get a real honest answer about this.
