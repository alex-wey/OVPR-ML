April 20 is upon us again, and the 420 day fashions have not changed. We're talking about the hemp wear pieces, which we know you have stashed somewhere in the back of your closet. If you haven't made -- or bought -- hemp jewelry on spring break, then you haven't truly lived. Aside from hemp accessories you wore in your teen years, hemp wear has gone mainstream in the realm of sustainable clothing. Eco-friendly lines, including Heather Heron , FEED , Edun and mainstay Stella McCartney , fashion almost any style of outfit or accessory to suit your boho, green-loving needs. But let's be honest: most still associate hemp and its fashion offspring with stoner culture. So in looking back at this 420 "holiday", we present you with ten hemp wear pieces from yesteryear.
