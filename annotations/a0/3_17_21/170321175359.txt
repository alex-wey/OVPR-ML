Talk show host Montel Williams is a vigorous supporter of medical marijuana. Williams uses the drug to combat symptoms from Multiple Sclerosis. And he isnt taking kindly to a new ad running in Arkansas that speaks out against bringing legal medical marijuana shops to the state. The former talker says the ad in question is racist to the core. Offensive is really an understatement. Its the most egregiously racist, false statement youve ever seen in your life, Williams reportedlytold the Little Rock crowd in regards to a TV ad that aired opposing the measure. Theyve people sitting in a picture holding guns, talking about medical marijuana, and of course they happen to be of different colors to make sure youre as irritated and angry as you can be.
