Tijuana, one of Central Americas safest states and home to most illegal migrants, has become an understudied and failed big-city detention center that has been developing into a magnet for thousands of people for two years now. Border Patrol agents raided the Mexican city on Sunday morning and seized 2,690 pounds of the drug equivalent of four marijuana plants, a 33 percent rise in that number in a single night, the Los Angeles Times reports.
People started to disperse, including children, some wearing masks and law enforcement officers responded with riot gear and shotguns in riot gear and in riot helmets, Mexican newspaper El Universal said, quoting military intelligence officers who were working with municipal police. At least seven families were arrested, including a man who is in custody in a mental health facility with severe head injuries, El Universal said.
El Universal reported on Monday that authorities in Mexico had issued orders for all Mexican asylum seekers, including those of Guatemala, in U.S. shelters for fear of returning home to murder more than 23 years after crossing the border illegally. A Mexican truck driver reportedly used a shotgun to kill a driver who was taking asylum seekers on one of the highways in the southern city of Reynosa.
The New York Times first reported the raids, and the Police Department in the Washington, D.C., city immediately condemned the raids, saying they amounted to a threat to public safety and endanger public health. However, Mayor de Blasio later made it clear the gangs motivation was not to get caught, but the detentions were precautionary to safeguard the officers from moving onto the streets of dangerous gangs who are largely absent from other areas that border Mexico, the Times reports.
