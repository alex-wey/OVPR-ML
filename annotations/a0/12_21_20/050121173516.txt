Fort Collins top cannabis producer thinks Colorado will see one million in sales this year, according to a new forecast by the Colorado Marijuana Industry Association.
The group forecasts Denver will be the site of one million sales, reports The Associated Press. Denver, by far the states biggest market, will generate half of the number of total pot sales.
During the 2013 campaign, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper said that the state had sent out $2 billion to the Department of Revenue. Hickenlooper has since declined to budge.

Colorado State University professor Michael Ledbetter says state residents may be paying more attention to the Colorado pot industry than Colorado residents are.
Theyre paying attention to Colorado out of curiosity, he told the Greeley Tribune. Its kind of contagious.
The group is calling on members of Congress to pass tougher marijuana laws including prohibitions on how much marijuana can be sold and websites that let minors buy the products. Ledbetter, who is deputy vice president of the Colorado State University Health Sciences Center, says marijuana is regulated and taxed like alcohol.
This is a state where you have cannabis for human consumption and people are already getting addicted to it, he said.
