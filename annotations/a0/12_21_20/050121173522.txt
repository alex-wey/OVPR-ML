A federal appeals court on Monday refused to throw out a law designed to ban possession of small amounts of marijuana without a specific ban on purchase by adults.
U.S. District Judge Peter Alexander, in Williamsburg, Virginia, had said that he couldnt give states the final authority to define retail marijuana sales in their state.
A finding by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond heard arguments that the ban does not infringe on other Americans constitutional rights or freedoms as a constitutional provision in state law.
Alexander said that theoretically, he didnt need to make that emergency request because a jury found it in Pennsylvania that law enforcement officers were violating that federal prohibition and that there is sufficient reason for the Court to uphold a distinction between the sale of marijuana for recreational purposes and interstate commerce.
Hamilton Williams, whose law firm was awarded the Georgia citizen case, noted that federal law does not distinguish between the sale of marijuana for recreational purposes and interstate commerce, adding that a finding by Alexander that state law has not been found in Virginia was itself inconsistent with the law.
The Georgia Supreme Court, as well as the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, rejected Alexanders ruling in December.
The case is Smith v. Perry. Williams, 4-1
