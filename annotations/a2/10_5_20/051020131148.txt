Of course not, scrub. The Cartels would do as the Mafia did: use their money, power and influence to reestablish themselves as legitimate business operations. And no, scrub. No. They can not "compete" with legal drugs by simply introducing new legal drugs. That is not how chemistry works. There is no "new and improved" version of heroin, for example. There is only more milligrams of the molecule or less milligrams of the heroin molecule... Or krokodil, which provides a similar high at the cost of melting your skin off... but people will make krokodil and will buy krokodil *because it's legal* and they can't get heroin. So. ironically, prohibition is what gives rise to your so-called "new drugs", because "new drugs" are means to circumvent detection through cheap, dangerous, experimental knock-offs. "Spice", for example, is billed as a *legal alternative* to marijuana. And bath salts, for example, are billed as a *legal alternative* to cocaine and amphetamines. And how do I know all of this? Because of Portugal. Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2001. And now they proudly report the fewest users of these "new drugs" among all countries with data tracking "new drug" users. Krokodil, Spice and Bath Salts aren't a big problem in Portugal, because Portuguese people can more safely use heroin, cannabis and cocaine.
