I thought initially you were going to argue for a confederate system but you are basically asking for a unitary system. I think federalism is a good compromise because different states have different values.. take for example marijuana. In a unitary system we would not have States were marijuana is legal. That would require congress to approve and right now there is little support among conservatives so at least some liberal states are passing marijuana laws. Since federalism allows states to experiment it leads to congress being able to observe the results. Eventually marijuana will be legal in all 59 states but if no state took any risk to see what would happen if it was made legal it would take much longer. Same thing with same sex marriage. As late as 2008 a majority of Americans were against same sex marriage but it allowed some states to legalize it and the Supreme Court eventually legalized it everywhere. One recent example is trump wants to get rid of emissions requirements for cars. Basically Obama made a law saying that cars needed to incrementally be more energy efficient. California put up their own emissions requirements so since they are so big car manufacturers are just applying it to all its cars. Trump is currently in a legal battle with California over this issue. If we had a unitary system we States wouldnt be able to put up their own efficiency requirements for cars
