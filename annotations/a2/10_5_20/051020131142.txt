>Not all drugs are addictive. Marijuana, LSD, and psilocybin for instance have no addictive effectsI didn't say that all were addictive but there are negative effects, being in an altered state makes you fundamentally less productive and for children who are still developing these can have negative effects. Hallucinogens have some potential for therapy in small amounts but people can also have very bad experiences from them and get PTSD when using them on their own.>Who are you to tell people what they can put in their own body. Who am I to tell people they can't murder each other, or steal, I'm just trying to look out for the best interests of people and our laws should be too.>Prohibition of alcohol and the tens of thousands who have been murdered due to the drug wars have proven prohibition doesn't work and is ineffective. I didn't advocate for that, I said I supported decriminalization, but I still think that there should be mandatory rehabilitation and that there are ways you can try and cut off supplies.>Tell me this, if the government can't prevent drugs from entering and circulating maximum security prisons how do you propose they do it out here? Obviously they can't prevent that 100% but they can still prevent it somewhere. Jesus christ you libertarians are stupid.
