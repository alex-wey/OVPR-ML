The federal government is in the midst of a crackdown on medical marijuana dispensaries across the state of California. This is despite repeated claims from President Obama and his Department of Justice that they would not devote federal resources to circumventing state medical marijuana laws. "The law has been hijacked by profiteers who are motivated not by compassion, but by money," said Melinda Haag, one of California's U.S. Attorneys, at a DOJ press conference on October 11, 2011. Aaron Sandusky, owner of G3 Holistic , a group of medical marijuana dispensaries in California's Inland Empire, is one such target of the DOJ's crackdown on medical marijuana "profiteers." The DOJ sent him a letter promising to shut down his operations within 14 days. And they followed through. Reason.tv talked to Sandusky, who's long battled the city of Upland's sordid handling of medical marijuana dispensaries, before and after he was raided. "We all want the same thing," said Sandusky. "We want to see less crime. That's why we have these places." Sgt. Glenn Walsh and Agent Mark Brewster, both members of the California Narcotic Officer's Association , believe that the stepped up enforcement from the DOJ is a positive development.
