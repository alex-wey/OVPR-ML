Pot is being legalized Canada Day, 2018. I think its stupid. "Keep the money from criminals the drugs away from kids" or something.. I saw someone bitching about legalization in Canada: "If its legal, there's a stupid new law that says I can't smoke it while I drive, or before I drive or I'll get a DUI."Uhhh... People don't realize it does affect your mind. You are impaired. You shouldn't drive after smoking. You shouldn't do a dangerous job.. I wouldn't want to work with someone smoking pot all day and night I weld, and a small mistake could harm someone.. Or if my doctor was high, etc.. They just banned menthol cigarettes because too many kids were smoking them. They can't keep cigarettes or alcohol away from them, so how will they keep pot out of their hands? Medical use, yes. Study it more, do as much research as you can, because there have been breakthroughs. But it isn't a magical cure. It doesn't help everything, sometimes medications or surgery is necessary. It isn't beneficial to some conditions, useless in others, can relieve symptoms in a few, and just be palliative in many.
