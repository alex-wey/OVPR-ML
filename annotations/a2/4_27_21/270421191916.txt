Would the black-market for weapons [or pot] become larger, or smaller if that buying/possession ban was lifted?... > There are a lot more gun freaks than pot headsHave you been to Canada? > if you want to buy pot in a store, go to Amsterdam, where crime and drug use has gone UP since they legalized marijuana... > Amsterdam does have a high crime rate. Poverty amongst a relatively large percentage of the population likely plays a role. So does the presence of tourists. Pickpockets and other thieves have their hands full, so to speak. > Much crime in Amsterdam is of a different nature, though. In recent years, a revenge-war amongst top criminals has resulted in a number of assassinations  with hits often taking place in public. > legalizing it won't solve ANY problems except making it easier for the average guy (like you) to go get some weed.- It will (really) lower the black-market for the drug, thus taking would-be profits away from those nasty Colombian drug lords- It would be taxed, bringing in millions of dollars for the government- The enforcement of the drug would be halted, freeing billions of dollars of spending.
