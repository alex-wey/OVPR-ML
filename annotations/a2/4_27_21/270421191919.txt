Definitely wouldn't go as far as calling these people losers and drug addicts (although I kind of see your point), but yeah, marijuana is constantly glorified here, as if it's some miracle plant that cures everything and turns you into a genius. No, it's really not that great. It makes you dumb, paranoid and lazy. All of this has been scientifically proven. Sure, THC has medicinal properties, but that doesn't mean rolling and smoking blunts will cure you of cancer - that's just fucking retarded. And for the record - I'm not anti legalization, I think every drug should at least be decriminalized, but I am definitely anti glorification. Cannabis is a mind altering substance and it should be approached with caution and treated with respect. I've seen it affect some people really badly. Especially, If you're predisposed for mental illness, it can seriously fuck you up. XXX has a few sacred cows and marijuana is one of them (others are cats, Breaking Bad, Bernie Sanders, comic books, "geek" culture in general, etc. you catch my drift) and if you say anything negative about it, you're gonna get downvoted into oblivion.
