Sounds to me like this has nothing to do with drugs, then. It has to do with following laws. For example, getting caught with marijuana can get you put in prison, prison is bad, therefore you shouldn't risk getting caught with marijuana. The best solution is to not do marijuana in the first place. I'm going to try two things here. First of all, what if I *knew* I wouldn't get caught? I had everything figured out, from removing the evidence of the crime to finding a reliable source of drugs. The system I had set up was absolutely fool-proof, and I therefore had no reason to worry about the legal consequences. Is it still wrong? Yes, it's illegal, but I don't agree with that law and I don't have to be concerned with the repercussions of using an illicit substance in the first place, since I won't ever get caught. If you think that it's wrong to break the law, period, why? If obeying a law requires you to go against your moral compass, why should you follow it? Because the government says so? Disobeying a law that goes against your own constitution is not a lack of self-control.
