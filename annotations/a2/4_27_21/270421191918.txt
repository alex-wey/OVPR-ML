President Obama got an endorsement from a medical marijuana group. Even more surprised? Mainstream marijuana activists, many of whom have never heard of the organization or its founder, Tom Leto. The major lobbying and advocacy groups have so far held off on endorsing a presidential candidate they say Obama hasnt lived up to a vow to back off raids. Our whole community was asking who is this clown? says Aaron Houston, executive director of the Students for Sensible Drug Policy . And conspiracy theories, unsurprisingly, bloomed. The U.S. Medical Marijuana Chamber of Commerces press release endorsing Obama claimed it has 10,000 members in chapters across the country, and its Web site lists a box-office address on a swank stretch of Pennsylvania Ave. The group does not appear to be incorporated, nor is it listed in nonprofit records or in Dun & Bradstreet. A lone press clip from a 2010 event in New Jersey is the only mention to be found. We reached Leto, who said the fact that no one had heard of him meant he has more work to do. As for the lack of a paper trail, he says its in the works.
