So, I want to jump in here as someone who actually doesn't smoke all that much (not on moral principles, I just don't like it). I agree that Marijuana use is on some level harmful to the body, as is the use of any substance, including those that are legal, like alcohol. However, I would argue that the harm caused by making it illegal far exceeds the societal burden created by damage to public health. By imprisoning, or even just fining, individuals for safely using a fairly common and relatively harmless drug, we create a significant, and unnecessary legal backlash, which costs a great deal to enforce. Furthermore, its worth noting that anti-marijuana laws have disproportionately affected the poor and communities of color, unintentionally making them tools of institutional prejudice. As such, legalizing cannabis use, with age restrictions similar to alcohol or cigarettes, would probably ultimately be a better choice for ensuring the public's welfare on the whole. > Studies have shown it can mess up one's brain-- especially if under the age of 25, which most weed smokers are. Also makes people lazy and unmotivated in life... we have enough of those people already in society.
