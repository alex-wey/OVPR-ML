In what advocates describe as an historic first, a trio of senators plan to unveil a federal medical marijuana bill Tuesday. The bill, to be introduced by Senators Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), would end the federal ban on medical marijuana and implement a series of reforms long sought by advocates. They include down grading its status with the Drug Enforcement Agency from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2, allowing doctors to recommend its use in some cases to veterans, expanding access to researchers and making it easier for banks to provide services to the industry. The Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States (CARERS) Act would allow patients, doctors and businesses in states that have already passed medical marijuana laws to participate in those programs without fear of federal prosecution, according to a joint statement from the senators offices. The bill will also make overdue reforms to ensure patients including veterans receiving care from VA facilities in states with medical marijuana programs access the care they need. The proposal will be unveiled at a 12:30 p.m. press conference on Tuesday, which will be streamed live here.
