As a person who once smoked pot, and doesn't anymore, I don't agree that weed isn't addictive. It may not be as addictive as cigarettes or heroin, but there is an addictive aspect to it. I have seen a friend make the switch from weed to meth, another was a great football player in highschool and is now on his third stint in jail. All because they didnt want to quit. They had all the chances in the world to quit, they had help, rehab, jail, all these chances to just stop. But they just said " its only weed, its not like I'm doing anything hard." It's the reason I quit, I watched what happened with almost everyone I hung out with back then, and it scared me straight. I'm not saying everyone will be this way, but I think to many are this way. And saying that imbibing weed doesnt hurt yourself is false, a girl in the area I am from stopped at a rest stop, smoked a bowl, turned into oncoming traffic and killed herself, and put a friend of mine and her brother in the hospital.
