Legendary boxing great Mike Tyson has broken ground on an $87 million marijuana ranch he is building in California.
Marc Wyshak, an Arizona-based real estate broker, said the first cattle ranch in California, which Tyson built himself and his entourage last summer in Spain, will house 100 employees. The 28,500-square-foot property at the corner of California and Glendale boulevards in Edgewood Hills will be larger than Oklahoma Citys Cattle Co., and will include mountain-facing oaks and sawgrass cacti.
The ranch, which will include 16 miles of roads and 700 acres of amenities, is one of the first sites Tyson has planned for cannabis, an area under cultivation in a little-known state. Tyson was the seventh richest person in California, according to Forbes, but more than half of those residents are illegal immigrants.
Wyshak and his firm, Garden of Agencies LLC, did extensive research to study the hard-to-prove population of California marijuana households. He said 60 percent of its clients are illegal immigrants or residents of Mexico and other countries with a Latin American eye for the poor and oppressed. The residents of Cabo San Lucas were the number one or two groups that Tyson monitored  without even having their names attached.
If you put $30,000 dollars into 10 families, the residents are actually less expensive than the adults, Wyshak said. I brought two children out to their homes to look around the place.
Wyshak said he first heard of the Discovery ranch from a tour of a zoo in 2017. Since then, it has grown from 12 acres into 7,700 acres. He estimates its owner to be worth $150 million.
