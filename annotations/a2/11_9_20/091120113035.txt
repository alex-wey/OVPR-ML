The Maryland Department of Health said it will allocate $4 million to study the impact of more than 25,000 marijuana smokers, even with the current expansion of the law.
Marijuana smoker Frederick F. McPherson said he preferred the two-way street scenario than a combined pot prohibition. But he can see the problem:
The proposal, if approved, would give wide-ranging consideration to the rural states with higher prevalence of marijuana use, unlike Maryland, which is fighting its prohibition entirely on marijuana. An existing statewide definition of marijuana for all illnesses would have to be softened to include other strains.
McPherson, a delegate from the East Coast who has sent pro-McPherson letters, supports the proposal, saying it will open the door to legal recreational use for addicts. And he supports HB 4170, which would increase the number of addicts to 72. Fifty-six percent of high-risk people in Maryland would be aided by this treatment.
The study will look at how the State treats marijuana use across the Board of Medical Marijuana and other medical marijuana-related recreational alternatives and issues. And McPherson said he thinks it will provide a positive focus on improving treatment for black users.
