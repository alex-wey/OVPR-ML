A D.C. policeman and his wife were arrested yesterday after an early-morning raid in which police found more than a pound of marijuana in their Northwest Washington, police reported. Police said Officer Donald L. Hood, 28, and his wife, Sharon Laverne Hood, 28, are charged with possession of marijuana, a violation of the Uniform Narcotics Act. The charge is a misdemeanor and carries a maximum one-year jail sentence. The Hoods had been charged originally with possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, a felony with a potential five-year penalty, but that charge was reduced in U.S. District Court yesterday. The arrests came after a three-week investigation by the Metropolitan Police Department's internal affairs division and the narcotics squad, police said. Acting on information from an informant, police said, they obtained a search warrant from a U.S. magistrate. The Hoods' home at 5313 14th St. NW was searched at 1:45 a.m. yesterday, police said. Police said they seized marijuana, a quantity of money and narcotics paraphernalia. Hood, a seven-year veteran of the police force, turned in his resignation immediately after his arrest, police said. He had been a uniformed officer attached to the first district substantion. Mr. and Mrs. Hood were released on their own recognizance and face a jury trial June 20 in D.C. Superior Court. The case was sent to Superior Court from U.S. District Court when the more serious charge against the officer and his wife were dropped in favor of the misdemeanor charge.
