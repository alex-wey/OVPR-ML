The wife of a D.C. Police officer had a home invasion at the Capitol a week earlier. The police officer, Robert Coombs, responded to a robbery call at a gas station in Columbia, but was forced to sneak out when she refused to let him get back to the station.
I turned around and saw the suspect come out of the store. I saw she entered the gas station, led her through the side door and did what was required to get out, says NYPD Det. James C. Sabathia. She then moved off into the dark, and I saw her run out of the store. After being abandoned in the store, she came back home and has been convicted three times for alcohol possession.
Ms. Coombs was charged today with felony robbery and three counts of felony breaking and entering.
She has been free on bail since she was arrested on April 5 on police identification charges.
Ms. Combs received more than $500 in cash from the person who saw her. I will fight to make sure I am not the accomplice that stole a $500 bottle of glass wine, she tells us.
Were giving her the money, Police Commissioner Joseph B. Caputo tells us.
