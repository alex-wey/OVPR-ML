I would also say each case requires you look into the history of the action with the probabilities of your end point. "If we do gay marriage now, next thing you know you can marry your horse." That's just ridiculous. Can I find some horse-marriage movement? Are people really pushing for that? No? It's a slippery slope fallacy. "If we allow medical marijuana now, next thing you know it'll be totally legal." Well, yes. For the last couple decades any idiot knew that the medical marijuana movement was an attempt to normalize it, to get people to see it's not the evil its detractors say it is, with the eventual goal of legalization. This isn't a slippery slope fallacy, it's recognizing the strategy."If you ban 'assault weapons' now, who knows what's next?" In this case we have plenty of evidence of increasingly strict gun laws over the years, and we have many groups saying they want to go much farther than that. The Brady Campaign even outlined a piece by piece strategy to lead to an eventual almost total gun ban. This isn't a slippery slope fallacy, it's recognizing the strategy. When a slippery slope is intentional, it is known as salami-slicing, or a salami strategy. Recognizing this strategy in play is not a slippery slope argument.
