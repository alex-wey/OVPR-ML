Hello bud! Thanks for asking such a crucial question. I recently had a great conversation with a friend of mine about this very topic, and we came to the conclusion that besides voting in the right party in 2015, we also should look into other avenues.- B. C. is currently trying to decriminalize with their sensiblebc. org movement, why couldn't we have something similar in QC? I think this is something we should look into and that is also something that could be done right away, without having to wait till 2015. If we want to look bigger, how about launching a country wide petition to decriminalize or make cannabis the lowest level of priority for all police forces country wide, and having that petition backing a parliamentary bill laying out possible terms of decriminalization written BY us FOR us? Reddit is a powerful tool that we need to harness and use more efficiently. I recently became mod for /r/Canadients , we're about to host an IAMA with someone from NORML canada that and I hope he will be able to shed more light on these options too. Supporting organizations like NORML canada and others are a good way to help further the case of legalization, but I think the best thing we can do is be aware of our role as Ents in society. Our biggest enemy is the stigma associated with cannabis from years of propaganda, the only weapon against propaganda are cold hard facts. We have to keep educating our fellow citizens when we can, but we also have to be aware that our actions as smokers can impact someone's whole perspective on the plant. We still have a ways to go, but as long as we have Ents like you who are interested in trying to make things happen and get involved, I'm confident the fight will be won soon enough. Toke on bud!
