If anyone thinks that legalizing weed with the provision that it will be regulated and taxed thinks any different, they're deluding themselves. RJ Reynolds and the other tobacco companies would essentially be given the keys to the kingdom and it would be made significantly difficult to compete with them. Regulations would also limit the amount of THC content. And the taxes would be likely to be very, very high. Why are they taxing it? They tax tobacco to reduce usage. If that's going to be the reason, supporting legalization at all hits a roadblock right there. They tax alcohol because it causes significant damage to society. Again, if this is the reason behind the taxation of marijuana then the proposal to legalize has its own defeat written into it. If they're taxing it to raise money for unrelated government programs and simply putting the money raised into the general fund... well, especially in California, the taxes will be very steep and will only climb. With no need to account for the programs the funds are going towards, it will be used as the funding for nearly everything. And growing your own would most likely just result in charges of tax evasion, like if you run your car on homemade biofuel.
