i've had a totally different experience with this. best one was sitting in a park with a spliff waiting for a movie to start with a mate. cop walks over so i drop it behind my leg but it was patently obvious, we'd been caught red-handed. He asks what we're up to so we just tell him the truth, "we're waiting to watch a movie in the cinema". I forget which it was but chatted with him about the film for a bit and after a while he goes, "right, well i came over because i thought i smelled weed but now that i'm here, i don't ;) have a good night" and promptly wandered off with his colleague. another time, a bunch of UCs caught us with a spliff-in-hand, asked a few questions, where we got it etc. (took our bag) but we obviously weren't going to give them a name. eventually the lady cop just went, "well, you seem fine. just buy it in didsbury and *smoke* it in didsbury". didn't give a fuck that we were budding a j outside an office block, just had to stop us cause we were on their block. IME, they just don't give a fuck. they have to be seen to uphold the law but for pissy shit like this they just don't care. i've been stopped no less than 5 times now without so much as a caution, i find just be amicable and they're generally pretty straight with you. of course, there'll be dickhead cops as well and this is just anecdotal but for the most part, i've found they don't give a fuck as long as you're not some prick-chav trying to act like a hard-ass.
