NORML article debunking this propaganda: r/Politics:>These points are pretty much bullshit. I'm not going to go through them one by one (others have and you can find those on the internet). Basically this is propaganda put out by growers and dealers that want to keep selling at blackmarket prices.>The penalty for contributing to a minor was taken directly from the alcohol laws. If you don't like it maybe the penalties for alcohol should be looked at too.>It lets you grow 25ft of weed! That alone is awesome. Even if you don't grow yourself your friend can give you weed 1oz at a time. They can keep as much weed as they want at the site of the garden, so just because you are limited to 1oz carrying around in public you can have 20lbs at your house that you grew in your garden, just don't go driving around with 20lbs in your car.>It doesn't get rid of the medical laws, it references them. How could a law make another law invalid and then reference that law? It can't.>You will be able to carry 1 oz with NO LEGAL PENALTIES. Right now you don't go to jail but you do get your scholarships and financial aid denied, you get fines and probation and whatever else happens. Sure, you don't go to jail but you do get a record.>The article starts out pretty lame and just gets worse. When I first saw this it floored me. It struck fear into my heart. Then I saw the writeup norml did about it refuting the claims line by line and I was relieved.>So, no, we shouldn't be having this discussion because some dipshit greedy asshole shouldn't have taken the time to write up this bullshit causing us to have to even have this discussion.>I rarely (pretty much never) downvote, but yes, I did downvote this. I think it is dangerous and misleading and degrades the quality of content on XXX as a whole.
