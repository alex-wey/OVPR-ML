If I am given the right to smoke hemp oil, then I will be less likely to prefer smoking cannabis over vaping, more likely to stay indoors, and even more likely to endure and vape for longer periods of time.
But Im not going to help you by telling you that you need to have energy drinks like kombucha because they dont always last, cant stay hot for a long time, or are always dry.
Why would you want to buy a vape just to jam up a smoker? Because all of that energy drink and vodka will do is win an argument and a pot smoker will feel the same.
And Im NOT the only one who has switched this mind. James Beard, the best-selling chef, has been demonizing the weed industry since he learned about it in 2012  only for me to reflect on the change in the parameters of the industry today.
Specifically, I want you to buy a small batch of hemp oil, which is highly toxic to humans. Because this stuff is highly likely to get into my ears when I smoke, youre going to lose your breath, end up in your lungs, and get a sore throat. And keep in mind, my lungs do not handle THC like other airways do.
This is exactly the type of thing that infuriates folks who can only get sick when they inhale it or think that its okay.
But mine happens to also include all sorts of bubbles  bubble dust capsules, which smells like normal bubbles and disappear easily, like little flakes of sugar.
So, following my request, Im going to be experimenting with hemp in these situations, and perhaps buying the hemp oil. I think theyll show some attention to the aesthetic changes. And Im also starting to wonder if they could help me quickly gain a measure of mental health.
And not incidentally, cannabis oil will also add another environmental health issue to this matter. This chemical thats bad for our lungs and/or our brains, can also cause fatal heart diseases as well as high blood pressure.
Im not just a vegan, but Im a wheat farmer, and Im certainly not a cannabis-dependent, higher caffeine user.
There are lots of medical reasons why most people dont smoke, but a lot of people I find think theyre trying to feed their ego, start a profession, or, at least make a habit of smoking cannabis oil.
