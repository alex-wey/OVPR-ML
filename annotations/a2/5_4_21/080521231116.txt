I think it's a mistake to portray it as surprising that someone over forty is pro-legalization. I know guys in California in their seventies that grow cannabis in their gardens for personal use and both my parents are in their sixties and are very much in favor of legalization and so are most of their friends. If you look at what happened in 2010 with California's legalization effort on a county-by-county basis the unfortunate fact is that places that are assumed to be conservative, rural and older in inland areas actually had sizable majorities in favor of the initiative. What ruined it was partly places like Mendo and Humboldt that shamefully voted it down in an ugly display of black market commercial interest before justice. But the really sad one was LA county where apparently the numerous dispensaries were telling their customers to vote no. That was fucked up. People don't pay attention to the break down though and they assume that it was those conservative old folks who didn't want it to go through. That's not what happened. But luckily what did happen was it was incredibly close despite the lack of support from the constituencies that should have been the most behind it. And that was in an off-year in which Republican turn-out was way high compared to Democrats. This time I'm almost sure it's going to go through. You already downloaded, printed and filled out the Regulate Marijuana Like Wine petition yeah? And you made extra copies for all your relatives too right? And you had them sign in front of you and bought them a stamped envelope too right?
