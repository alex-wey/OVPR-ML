Your OP to me sounds like you are trying to say that while *some people* may get distracted by articles on arbitrary details of a case that are irrelevant to the actual issue, *the media* themselves aren't intentionally trying to distract people with these details. In the end, the point of the media is to provide a kind of entertainment for people and to get views and therefore turn a profit. Whether that means that a writer feels a click-baiting article about how "Trayvon Martin had trace amounts of marijuana in his blood!" which A) would have made him less aggressive not more aggressive, and B) was so small it could have been second hand and C) has nothing to do with the fact that he was the victim who was chased and killed... doesn't mean that the media is purposefully trying to distract people from reality, but rather just trying to create a media spin that will draw in their viewers. It's not a legitimate distraction so much as it is an irrelevant argument made to entice people who don't actually understand what's going on, but in the end, these things do pull people away from the actual issues. Now, I agree, I don't think there's some big conspiracy constantly going on where someone is killed over here so we don't hear about this going on over here (which is funny, because in the end, these things we "don't hear about" somehow were heard by these theorists, so somebody has to be covering them...), I think the issue is that the media is so focused on pulling views with sensationalism that it dilutes the reality, as in my example above.
