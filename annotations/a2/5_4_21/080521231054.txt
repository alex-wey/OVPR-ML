Eh your statement is painful to read. It is full of ignorant babble.>therefore the price will be HUGE. Drugs would go down in price due to the lack of risk involved. The cost to produce a $50 bag of weed is around 50 cents. The reason it's expensive is because of the illegal risk. The different companies would lower the prices to where the market dictates. You don't see black market smuggling of alcohol do you? You are talking like only drug traffickers are effected by the gang violence. There are countless innocent bystanders and witnesses that are murdered every year. Your are arguing that all mind altering substances should be illegal, which is retarded. Live in a Saudi Arabia if that's what you'd prefer. I'd prefer a place where I can smoke cigs, drink liquor, smoke a bowl, or huff drain-o if I please, as long as I am not directly harming anyone else. And for your seemly pointless anecdote about the kids in the park, I'm not saying you should be able to smoke pot next to playgrounds or drink booze anywhere you please. Responsible consumption of anything should not be outlawed period. This even further proves the point that even though it's currently illegal it still goes on. Better to regulate. Do some reading on how well alcohol prohibition worked out.
