i finally thought of something worth writing to Obama about marijuana. So here it is:By watching President-Elect Obama's successful campaign and hearing him voice his opinions on numerous issues, it has become evident to me that he understands the ineffectiveness of any campaign based on fear tactics and lies. Much of Barack's platform has been constructed on the assumption that the American people are intelligent and make the best decisions when fully informed on an issue, and for that I am grateful. With an understanding of this creed, I ask that President Obama urgently address America's true priorities in its war on drugs. The true epidemic in America today is Methamphetamine addiction among teenagers in rural communities. The help that is required is not an impossibly expensive DEA operation, but an educational and treatment investment in our nations human infrastructure. I have found an ideal source of funding for this operation. Divert all resources from all anti-marijuana operations being conducted by DEA and any other federal agency. Sovereignty on this issue should lie with the state, if an individual is morally opposed to the regulations in a given state, they can easily move to a state with laws that suit them. Voter initiatives in several states have shown the undeniable will of the people. It is supposed to be the duty of the government to serve the will of the people, not dictate it. Change is in the air, our current policies on have made illegal drugs more accessible to children than alcohol, built empires from drug money, and massively inflated America's private prison industry. Now that we are starting with a clean slate on so many issues, let us also look beyond the talking points on this issue and do the right thing for America.
