>for a case about why predicting pricing during prohibition is not as simple as you're making it sound. Your sources seem to indicate that the complexity comes in mostly when measuring usage rates in relation to price. They seem to show pretty consistently that while there were mitigating factors to the price, it was higher than it was before 1920. Neither had specific data that I saw on price trends after Prohibition ended.>1) I don't actually think the base price will change all that much since weed is semi-legal right now for medical use. Medical cannabis may be semi-legal to sell/buy and legal to use, but the supply chain is still extremely iffy if not outright illegal under state laws. This gray market supply is a major part of what keeps the price high.>2) The additional taxes that will inevitably be added in (which are part of the reason for the prop in the first place) will offset any reductions. This is certainly possible, but it means at worst, cannabis prices will stay the same. I highly doubt they will increase. Demand may go up but so will supply.>I still think the price is going to at least stay somewhere in the same range of where it's at now, at least for a while. Change will take time. I doubt the price will drop overnight.>I would love to be wrong in this case, but either way, I still intend to vote yes so we can reduce the number of people getting in trouble with the law over something so dumb. As I said, I fully admit the price may stay the same, or only drop marginally, especially at first, but I highly highly doubt that it will increase. Either way, I agree completely with your last sentence. :)
