I agree with this. There's the danger of dealers and such (which WOULD technically be removed with legalization, I live in oregon and we have very safe dispensaries on every block) My main problem is that there ARE health problems involved with weed. You can deny the loss of brain cells all you want, but if you look at the idiot kids who are actually using it, they're all fucking morons. I was one of those kids who smoked weed all the time and it fucked me up. I HATED feeling like I was a vegetable all the time, and it took me a while of trying to gain my memory back and my emotions to return to my normal state. The worst part though was the derealization it gave me. I had already had anxiety and weed magnified it to millions. There's a whole XXX dedicated to this (r/dpdr) and most of it is caused by marijuana. It's terrible. It also smells terrible. I have nextdoor neighbors growing and the awful skunk smell can be sniffed out every single time you go outside. So yeah. Turns kids into idiots, gives some people derealization, and smells awful. Should stay illegal.
