I've had bouts with depression for most of my life and chronic pain in my joints for sports injuries and work, along with other various bangs and bruises. Weed is literally a miracle drug for me and I never would've thought before I moved to a legal place. I remember a weekend where I had to deal with the pain of a abscess in my tooth that needed a root canal and crown. If I didnt have my little supply that weekend I wouldve seriously thought about killing myself because that was the worst pain I've ever been in and the meds I was prescribed did nothing but make me vomit from nausea. I couldnt eat or drink anything, and I would take a pill which made me nauseous but didnt stop the pain and I'd throw up the pill before it could really hit me so I'd need to take another and it was a cycle of pain nausea and vomiting. I had to wait until monday morning to see them and it was the worst 48 hours of my life, I genuinely might have killed myself if I didnt have my girlfriend by my side. Before I'd moved here I was 100% against weed not against legalizing it but I'd never had any desire to try itEverybody has different things but for me, this was a life changer. No more going to bed with my knees aching and my back hurting. No more panicking about this or that existential dread. That being said some people for sure overdo it and need to be reined in. You can totally become addicted to that detachment from reality and whatever else if that's the reason you're using it. A tolerance break never hurt anyone too
