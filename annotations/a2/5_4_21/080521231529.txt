Marijuana has a few problems and I'm sure there will be more and research becomes more open. Influenza I believe is one of a few physical symptoms for smoking. What makes marijuana unique from many drugs is how it's not chemically addictive. Many hear this and shorten the phrase to "it's not addictive" for the sake of their bias agenda. However, it is psychologically addictive, very psychologically addictive. Our brain works like this: if something makes you happy and you're in need for happiness, keep doing it. For those in need of happiness, weed is a very dangerous habit that generates those stereotypes that do nothing but smoke all the time and cannot quit. This is similar to other psychological addictions that are also overlooked, like sex addiction or various food eating disorders. It's a serious problem, but the bias will dismiss it as not dangerous because it's simply not chemically addictive and physical side effects are so low. Of course, for the wrong people the consequence can be observed and documented to be severe with the wrong time for wrong people. I could go on a longer rant, but nothing more needs to be said. Weed isn't as bad for you as say anything else, but that's not a legitimate argument when discussing whether it is or is not dangerous, it simply is with an irresponsible user, which sums up majority of individuals that don't know this overly common knowledge.
