I'm sorry but your post seems very... Inaccurate I guess. Barely anybody wants it legalized for the sole purpose of being a cure. Yes, it is one of the reasons that people want it legal, but you can't say people who want it legal are short minded. There are other reasons to legalization, such as how it *is* fairly safe. Better than alcohol, and that is legal. Also, we are wasting tax dollars and labour for the imprisonment of people who were using marijuana. Do you think it is right to ruin a person's life because of smoking a plant that makes the happy? We can also generate alot of money for us if it is sold in stores and taxed.Also, one of the reasons why tobacco was assumed safe is because we didn't have all the technology to analyze it that we do today. When we got this tech, we realized that it was bad. Now with pot, he have analyzed it and it is shown that it is not so bad. TL;DR being a cure is not the only reason people want it legalized, saying that people who want it legal are short minded is infactual and just doesn't make sense.
