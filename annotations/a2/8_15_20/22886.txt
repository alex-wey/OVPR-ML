Thank you. People downplay the mental effects of weed too much. It's the same thing with alcohol. Not everyone who drinks will end up with problems (though many do) and they either deal with it or quit.It's literally the same thing with weed. And a large portion of people who smoke weed and might have some mental effects just continue smoking, so they never find out what those effects are. People say weed isn't addictive, but I can tell you there definitely is a craving sensation after you smoke for a while. Plus, you feel shitty without weed if you've been toking constantly for a long time. Isn't that the same thing as withdrawal? If not in a physical sense, then in a mental sense (due to lack of cannabinoids in the brain lifting your mood). Then again, since the brain is a physical organ, maybe it is physical.But I digress, some people can deal with it just fine - but there are downsides to consistent weed usage. Mainly mental. It makes you lazy as shit compared to if you were sober. It can lead to depression, anxiety, or just lowered motivation and drive in general. It's funny because all these kind weed downsides were commonly referenced by stoners themselves or stoner movies, songs, etc. I'm not saying that everybody will experience these things, but that they are a real possibility. This kind of reminds me of the backlash people would get when someone pointed out the deleterious effects of cigarettes or alcohol back in the day - I'm talking about decades ago. Most people said they were fine and that it was bullshit. But look where we are today. I think it'll take time until people calm down and actually assess the situation.I'm all for legalization and recreational use. But seriously, all things in moderation.
