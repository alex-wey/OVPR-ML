You know... There was a time when I probably would have agreed with you. In the 1960's, 1970's when we were really just entering the age of the large administrative state and were trying to figure out how to write huge laws of general application. I would have been a big proponent of writing broad laws and then allowing prosecutors to use their discretion in their application to make sure the intent of the law was done.Then we started locking up like half of all african american men, and more people than any other country in the world. We started to absolutely crush people's lives because they didn't want to sell a wedding cake to a gay couple. We expanded the scope of laws a thousand fold, and we got affluenza kid. We got teenagers being charged with manufacturing child pornography cause they sent they bf a topless pic and their teacher took their phone and searched it without their consent.So you know, I am completely done with the idea that special people shouldn't be treated the same way. I think if Hillary clinton got caught smoking weed she should go to jail for as long as a black 25 year old with a criminal record.Either the laws apply to the king as much as they do the lowest person, or we revert to the 1600's.Do you know we have more people in jail by a % of our population than Russia, Iran, or China?
