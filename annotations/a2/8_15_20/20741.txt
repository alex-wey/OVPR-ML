That doesn't answer anything the poster saidIt offers an evidenced theory as to why cannabis has a medical effect on the human body and isn't simply an excuse to get stoned. See the answer to the third question below.  The endocannabinoid system processes chemicals secreted by the human body. It functions and is useful even in somebody who doesn't use cannabis at all.Exactly. Medicine is used because something is wrong and a symptom needs to be addressed.   Claiming that the existence of chemicals in nature that our body can process does not mean our bodies developed in symbiosis with those chemicals. Which is why theories are explored and supported or discarded. Plant cannabinoids interact with humans in specific ways within the endocannabinoid system. So the symbiosis is simply an established fact. This symbiosis has known medical applications.Humans are just another mammal on a space rock who happened to have evolved an endocannabinoid system to regulate certain mammal body functions. Humans can also process external plant-derived cannabinoids to known therapeutic effects. On this human-inhabited space rock grows a cannabinoid plant which may be one of the first human domesticated plants stretching back into our unknown prehistory.I may be using the term "evolve" a little loosely, but the connection between the plant, the mammal and these specific chemicals occurred on a small space rock over a long period of time.  You're making the same mistake as those Intelligent Design folks.No need to be snarky, but you do raise a hilarious point.If one is to assume a cosmic watchmaker, then she designed da weed for a reason. Christians should be the biggest pot heads. God made grass after all. Or is that the infamous tree of the knowledge of good & evil that pisses god off so much?
