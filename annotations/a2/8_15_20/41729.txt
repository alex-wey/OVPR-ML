Some porn is ok, but there’s some abuse porn, stretching, fisting, spitting, peeing, pooping, etc. Remember the 2 girls 1 cup. Would you want a 16 yr old masturbating to that thinking it’s normal?This is where my last line in the actual bit of the argument comes in about parents making sure their child is safe and informed. I agree there are genres of porn that you can stumble upon that promote unsafe ideas i.e. abuse, rape, etc. but generally you need to include those sorts of things as search terms in order to actually find them. Children should be taught this sort of thing is wrong and that consent and a condom are the golden two for any encounter they may have in the future. I also believe children are smart enough to realise things like 2 girls 1 cup aren't exactly the norm. There is always going to be ways for pre adults to view pornography, whether there is a law in place or not.Which is why instead of stigmatising it and discouraging conversation, we should promote safe and secure ways people can use pornography. In the UK, marijuana is an illegal drug to distribute despite it being relatively safe compared to many other drugs (including alcohol and tobacco). However, classifying it as similar to cocaine or meth has restricted the conversation on it and causes people to become misinformed about the effects of the drug and stigmatises those who use/sell it. *Despite the law, people will still consume marijauna. However, the law has caused misinformation regarding it's consumption which has lead to worse circumstances than the act itself.*
