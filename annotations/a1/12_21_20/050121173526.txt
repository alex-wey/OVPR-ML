In a video posted to social media on Saturday, Rodrigo Duterte declared that there is nothing to laugh about, but did not offer any recommendations to lift his ban on smoking weed.
Youre laughing all the time, thank God, the president tweeted. I smoked marijuana at my latest meeting with United Nations on corruption.
The remarks, posted ahead of the World Economic Forums (WEF) World Climate Summit in Davos, Switzerland, continue a longstanding pattern of denials from Duterte. Critics have latched onto the retired de facto head of states vulgar remarks, including on his retweeting of a Bastille Day poem on gay rights, which held that he didnt like lesbians.
At the BELUBACOS [LGBTI civil society coalition], we all knew they had everything to prove, he tweeted. Still, theres something wrong when you will call homosexuals and silencing them would be beneficial for everyone.
According to The New York Times, the countrys UN Human Rights body last month condemned Dutertes comments, saying that they were offensive and contrary to the views expressed by rights advocates of Latin America and the Caribbean, who have consistently raised concerns about his behaviour.
(The Times also cited UN officials as saying the comments were intended to push Duterte more deeply, increasing their likelihood of arresting him if he rules out criminal prosecution.)
Among the most notable specifics mentioned in Dutertes taunt is the anticipated time it will take the United Nations to investigate alleged serious violations of human rights perpetrated by the Duterte administration.
(And of course, Duterte did not promise anything about that, just saying he was still cracking.)
