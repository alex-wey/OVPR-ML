Houston, Texas  A missing toddler for a Christmas day crisis crisis came to his moms rescue when he set his moms Houston apartment on fire for refusing to buy pot, a cousin of Houstons mayor said on Monday.
In a Facebook post, officials confirmed that Adam Clayton Powell Jr., 4, was in Houston on Christmas Eve but did not confirm the incident, prompting the arrest of Cesar Levesque, who is charged with his cousin for refusing to buy pot.
When the fire started at [Adam]he was screaming for a gun, said Powells cousin, Aaron Castro. I heard the smoke go up and I started crying, he said, while adding that staff members then tried to help with a physical home invasion.
The fire had just begun in the bathroom but started elsewhere, said Castro. He said that he had planned to call 911 if he and his family got separated again.
Powells cousin David DeCosta, who lives a block away from Powell, said that whatever fire incident that just occurred happened so quickly, he was shocked and ashamed. He and the other family members of Powells lived in the home and his parents were there.
They were all fine in here, DeCosta said. Our whole thing was the only three blocks away.
Powells cousin, however, said that it was God, not an officer or a police officer that got him into trouble.
God is not an officer of law enforcement, I think, he said. We knew it was a possible fire. We were trying to help him and just call 911, when we heard the smoke go up. We just ran to the front of the house and did it. I helped them in the garage and I stopped them from starting an operation.
DeCosta also said that his son immediately alerted police after spotting the fire and that they quickly responded by setting Powells apartment ablaze.
The cause of the fire is still unknown and its unclear if a Houston police officer or official investigation is taking place.
In December, a mans family in Houstons Del Rio neighborhood were ordered to evacuate their building because of a threat from an arsonist. Neighbors allegedly claimed that a third fire in the building was caused by items inside.
California is known to be the countrys most dangerous state for fires. Law enforcement officials in this state have faced fire threats for months and between 2010 and 2012, 1,435 cases were reported to the Homeland Security Investigations Unit.
