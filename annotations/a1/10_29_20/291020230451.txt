Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin vowed Monday to veto a marijuana ban proposal that the state had been debating for months, saying it violated state law.
Shumlin, who also opposed the bill in January, said in a statement that the bill would violate state law by legalizing what he considered a dangerous transaction.
The bill, which Shumlin says was wrongly codified as a bad law for Vermont, makes it illegal to possess, distribute or buy the recreational marijuana and other drugs commonly used in the state.
Vermont lawmakers, who are still deciding whether to legalize marijuana and see if Shumlin would veto the ban, said they have spent much of the past week studying the plan. Shumlin could veto the bill and the governor could recommend a later veto.
