During an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, comedian Montel Williams criticized fellow radio talk show host Glenn Beck for supporting medical marijuana during his recent Fox News segment.
Williams said Beck has never taken a position on legalizing marijuana, and has been so pleased with the way his treatment of the drug has improved that hes reportedly even offered an off-camera interview to Beck about the drug.
This is their last Thursday show and thats what I like to do, and so Im not going to sit here and get fracked up, Williams said. I went to the doctor in Ohio and they say they didnt know I had marijuana and I think they did it correctly. They dont say I have any, like, hardcore weed. Just I have compassion.
Williams said the staff at the Beck-covered radio program thinks its crazy that the president might even consider using medical marijuana, according to the Huffington Post.
Ive been sick for 20 days now, Williams told Kimmel. When I am sick, its almost like I must say this  feels like new medicine.  But if Obama would let this happen, hed know how much this affects people.
Williams said Becks characterizations of medical marijuana are totally off base.
I think he might want to get familiar with it and understand the big-picture problems that it would bring about, Williams said. Medical marijuana is a problem that the entire Obama-care biz had no way of fix itself.
Lawmakers are considering regulating medical marijuana for recreational use, saying the drug could reduce abuse and potentially help reduce mental illness rates.
