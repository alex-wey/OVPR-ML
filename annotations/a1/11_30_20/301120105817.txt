What other license to violate societal norms can the Democratic Party endorse? Now its drugs. Texas Democrats have joined with other supporters of legalizing marijuana in urging the federal government to decriminalize the drug. In the partys platform, the Democrats are asking the White House, the Department of Justice, and Congress to back such a move. In the platform, the Democrats claim that 85 percent of the arrests made related to marijuana are only for possession, not distribution, and the government outlawing the drug only gives control to the drug cartels and street gangs. They say marijuana should be treated like alcohol and tobacco: Decriminalization of marijuana does not mean we endorse marijuana use, but it is only a call for wiser law enforcement and public health policy. Recent polls show over 50 percent of Americans believe marijuana should be decriminalized. Gilberto Hinojosa, the Texas Democratic Party chairman, said, you shouldnt put a criminal stigma on these young folks for the rest of their lives. It is becoming apparent that the Democratic Party wants to control Americans lives in every way but one: what to do with their bodies in any way that counters traditional morality. Whether its abortion on demand or legalizing drugs, the Democratic Party now represents a libertine hedonistic lifestyle which brooks no opposition and eschews personal responsibility. And this move by the Texas Democrats is more of the same.
