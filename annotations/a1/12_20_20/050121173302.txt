The city closed its Oak Brook Park to a group of teens last month, citing safety concerns in an elementary school in the suburb as a factor in the closure.
According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, the teenaged teens spent nearly 20 hours at a brick-and-mortar elementary school on Oct. 9, 2009. ODPH says it sent a letter to the school letting them know the closing was effective immediately, and permitting the teenaged students to play in an outdoor field was "harmful."
The teenaged students had not been told yet whether there was a link between a possible drug use and any trouble at the school.
While the school was closed, the area was sealed off to students from the surrounding neighborhood, and now, "private property would be sold for property taxes."
Thus, Oak Brook Park became the latest new community pond to be forced to shut down by ODPH, even though it didn't technically raise any local taxes. The lack of a single levy raised about $8 million, and it was defeated in a City Council vote in November 2009.
Tribune news reporter Maureen O'Connor reported on the controversy shortly after it became public.
Noting the decline of ODPH, she noted that it was also home to the world's most heavily trafficked drug street, which occurred in, among other cities, Newark, New Jersey, and Denver, Colorado.
Noting other jurisdictions, including Texas, have also considered closing school districts. Although Chicago said it would return to the school district for its safety, New York City passed a law denying the district a return.
