HELENA, Mont. (Reuters) - A new law, legalizing recreational use of marijuana for medical purposes, sends a warning that long-running restrictions on medical marijuana in other states could curb global opinion about the risks.
What does legal marijuana do to freedom of speech? It certainly mocks the dark side that is in its substance, said researcher Professor Jeff Telos.
The new Dutch law imposes restrictions on any business trying to operate in other countries, stating that any violation of these terms will result in place-based licensing restrictions with the announcement of the law, Telos said.
It comes with one sentence, he said. It says it is illegal to come to the Netherlands with personal property that might not be safe.
The bill also criminalizes at least one member of an individuals family or business, requires instant inspections and discloses details about the business to the public, and infringes on journalists and other fair-minded activists.
Marijuana has proven to be a panacea to the scourge of violence against women, men and children. We are not going to stand idly by and watch it grow unchecked, Prime Minister Peter Balkenende said in a statement on Thursday.
This is about allowing countries to come together, he said, to experiment with a culture based on respecting rights in everyday life.
Telos said young teens may be on the prowl for marijuana while their parents are worried about watching children grow their own.
A university researcher at the U.N. Office for Drugs and Crime told Reuters last week that decriminalizing marijuana would be devastating to domestic violence and impunity, warning that even with enhanced enforcement they would pose an obstacle for gang membership.
News reports suggest legal recreational users are being educated about the dangers of the drug and keep it out of their homes. But experts think smoking a bag of marijuana  something legal in the Netherlands  cannot be used legally.
