That does not mean that society doesn't have an issue. An issue that you would not give two fucks about it you didnt have severe anxiety even being around alcohol. > Society should change for itself. Don't be so disingenuous. Do you not know how transparent youre being here? Do you really think anyone reading this would believe that was your real concern?> Poison. A substance that attacks your brain and can easily kill you. More exaggeration. Is that what youre worried about? Really? Do you know how much alcohol it would take to kill you? Easily or otherwise? Orders of magnitude more than what your average person drinks in any given situation. But thats not the issue. You cant even be around a person having a glass of wine, right? > Your hypothetical of a person who is afraid of dogs is a straight up fallacy and I can't even begin to address it. Its literally the exact same thing.> Why is alcohol legal while marijuana is not? Why is ecstasy and LSD outlawed? Just because society tells us it is okay, does not mean that it is. More faux concern.
