The news today from Gallup is that, for the first time in its polling, a majority indeed, a solid majority of Americans back legalizing marijuana. So far, most politicians have stuck with support for the status quo, or perhaps the status quo plus various exemptions and loopholes. With 58 percent of all respondents and 65 percent of Democrats favoring legalization, however, theres now a very good chance that a fair number of ambitious Democratic politicians are going to sign up for full legalization as a way to differentiate themselves in Democratic primaries. Matt Yglesias suggests that Hillary Clinton will be among them . I think thats perhaps premature, but maybe not. The way this probably will unfold is that a fair number of candidates will take a legalization position, and some may even try to run hard on it, in 2014 elections and especially Democratic primaries. If its perceived to be successful, then expect Clintons competitors for 2016 to flirt with or perhaps even embrace the position. Only after that or at least, only after its clear that it will happen would I expect Clinton to go along.
