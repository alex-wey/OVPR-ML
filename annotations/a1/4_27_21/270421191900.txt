However, a very similar ridiculous scenario is playing out right now in the State of Arizona, where a new state law permits the distribution of marijuana for medical purposes. And Judicial Watch has stepped into the battle. Judicial Watch filed an amicus curiae brief in the Court of Appeals of the State of Arizona, District One, in support of Maricopa County and the State of Arizonas lawsuit appealing a December, 4, 2012, Maricopa Superior Court ruling that the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (AMMA) did not conflict with federal drug laws. In its brief, Judicial Watch maintains that the AMMA, which permits the use of marijuana for medical purposes, is a direct violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which makes it unlawful to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense any controlled substance: Federal law is unambiguous in that marijuana is a controlled substance regulated under a comprehensive statutory and regulatory scheme. As such, the production, sale, and use of marijuana, other than as part of a federally authorized research program, is a violation of federal law regardless of any state law permitting such activities even in a limited manner.
