your marijuana didn't fall from the sky and wasn't manufactured in a factory in america. even if it was grown here, the seeds came from a place where people die over the drugs. it's sold along side cocaine and other dangerous drugs by people who kill people. if you look at the drug USE being safer... sure, if you ONLY look at the use by white teens in the suburbs. you guys need to see the entire picture here. I'm not bashing weed, I'm just saying these stories are misleading by saying "drugs are safe." I don't want to get into a rant about it because frankly I don't care that a bunch of white kids smoke weed after school. weed by itself is a harmless drug, but the way it's produced and delivered harms more people than alcohol ever could. think of alcohol during prohibition... even then, the drug trade is still more dangerous. another analogy I made was hybrid cars. they're touted as better for the environment... but that's misleading: the technology that goes into PRODUCING hybrid cars is a LOT worse than what it takes to produce a Hummer H3 or Ford Excursion.
