Obama is not in favor of legalization, but where do you get the idea that he will definitely take action to stop legalization? What the hell do you think "not in favor of legalization" means? He has come out and said multiple times, he believes that using marijuana damages people, that it harms their life, that they shouldn't do it, that they should be prevented from doing it. He voted to increase the prison terms of first-time possession offenders. > as far as i've been able to see, he seems to be in favor of states handling this issue (hence the "no federal resources used to prosecute those in compliance with state drug laws"). He is somewhat OK with states handling the MEDICAL marijuana issue. He has never made any statements about anything else. And, really, his statements on that don't make any sense. He is maintaining the federal laws against it when he could be moving to remove them. He is specifically maintaining the ability for the feds to raid these places, fight it in court a bit, and, as they always do, win big and gain an even more permanent place for the Drug War.
