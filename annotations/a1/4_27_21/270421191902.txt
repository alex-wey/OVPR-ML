I am in support of legalizing marijuana and I do not mind admitting that partly i want it legalized just so i can smoke weed where ever i want. But at the same time I also think that I would be great for the economy. I would product an influx of cash by being taxed and it would also free up cash being spent housing "criminals" arrested for possession. In 2007 there were a total of 1,841,720 drug arrest, 872,720 of those were for marijuana. Now many people might say that those are good stats for the supposed "war on drugs" that the US had "working on", but what you need to take into consideration is how many traffickers have been arrested. out of the total marijuana arrests made only 97,583 have been for trafficking or sales. A total of 775,137 have been for possession, to me this does not look like a "war on drugs" but a war on users. And when you take into consideration that on average it cost $52 a day to imprison a person, and the average sentence for possession is up to 6 months.
