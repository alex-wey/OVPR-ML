But this is an election year, and he is more concerned with getting reelected. So if he knows that he needs to call for a few raids, and not push for decriminalization in order to gain a few moderate Repub voters, or swing voters (not sure of the exact term here); he's going to do that. Long story short, I think he's taking it easy. No use shooting himself in the foot. Now let's look at the next four years, supposing BO wins. He cannot be reelected, so I think there's a MUCH bigger chance for him to go along with decrim measures, and legalization issues. He's younger, he was a smoker, and he knows people care about the issue. The man isn't dumb, he knows how popular legalization is. But in his first term, and in an election year, he won't risk losing it by implementing those things. Let's get BO back in office for another 4 years, and see if we can get something out of him. With less pressure to get back in office, I would be EXTREMELY surprised if he didn't take the first major steps towards decriminalization or legalization.
