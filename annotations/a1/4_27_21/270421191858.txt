ancient Egyptian tombs had cannabis in them. several other ancient cultures have used a wide range of intoxicants, not just alcohol. as for your argument about crime rates during the prohibition era - prohibition is what allowed organized crime to gain a foothold in modern society. there were more illegal drinking establishments and speak-easies in NYC at that time than there are liquor stores today. there will always be supply if there is a demand. it was true then, the same is true now. if pot were legal, the government and society writ-large would be benefiting instead of criminals flying below the radar. finally, yes there have been major crack downs on drunk driving, but it is certainly NOT vilified in modern movies or television. The Hangover series certainly proves that. if you want to use an example that works, take cigarettes. modern smoking rates are way down from several decades ago. This is because of public health awareness campaigns as well as limiting tobacco advertisements, and disallowing tobacco use in public spaces. If cannabis was made legal, and was done so with a similar public health awareness campaign, rather than the misinformation we have now, where would the problem be?
