Mexican authorities found a marijuana growing operation inside a state-owned oil refinery not far from the border with Texas. The drugs were found in the same plant that was recently visited by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO). The discovery took place this week in Cadereyta when Federal Police officers found 45 marijuana plants hidden within the brushy back area of the facility. Cadereyta is approximately 110 miles south from the border city of Reynosa. The refinery is run by controversial state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex). Information provided to Breitbart News by law enforcement sources revealed the plants were initially found by Pemex security guards who contacted federal authorities. The rear part of the facility is federally restricted but rarely supervised, law enforcement sources revealed. In May, AMLO and Nuevo Leon Governor Jaime Rodriguez Calderon visited the refinery to oversee a series of repairs. It remains unclear how federal authorities who oversee AMLOs security missed the grow operation.
