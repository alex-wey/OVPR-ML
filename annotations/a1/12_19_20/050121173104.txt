A 13-year-old boy living in the Boston suburb of Westbury died Thursday of an apparent accidental overdose of marijuana and other drugs, officials said.
The boy told authorities Wednesday that he was arrested because of marijuana at a Westbury elementary school where he was living and thought he had tried for too long, said Westbury police Chief William Weinreb.
"The medical marijuana is what really helped him die this way," Weinreb said.
Authorities later found marijuana, oxycodone and LSD in the boy's possession, Westbury Chief of Police Robert David said. But, Weinreb said, the boy had "purely self-control"  that is, he was not picking up his child from school and getting it from other people with no control.
The boy was taken to Rhode Island Hospital, but died a short time later.
Westbury Police Chief William Weinreb told XXX that under the Massachusetts medical marijuana law, children can legally possess up to a total of five or six grams of marijuana or any other drugs for recreational use. Under state law, the boy was guilty of a Class B misdemeanor when the legal age for the possession of the drug is 12 years old.
Officials found numerous but unlicensed goods that they said appeared to be intended for dispensing to adults, including a glove box, a baggie of pure ice, a $30 set of spring bulbs, a dead-bolt switch switch and a $30 set of homemade gloves.
A legal dispensing bag at the school mentioned "pain enhancers and marijuana edibles," Weinreb said. State law says possession of the four healthy drugs must be made within 100 yards of the school.
Weinreb could not give a statement when asked if a medical marijuana regimen was recommended in Westbury, saying it could be expanded after police investigation.
