I am not assuming there is mass consent on the issue at all. Its an issue that Conservatives have used to solidify their support from a specific portion of the populace. I'd argue all criminals have a mental health issue of some form. I'd argue that a person who has reoffended 21 times is a threat to society - and the system has failed in labeling him so. I would fully support the full and complete legalization of cannabis - no death is ever attributed to cannabis. However I do support drugs like meth, heroin, ... being illegal - these are drugs that do serious harm to users and the people around the users - it cannot be argued otherwise. The war on marijuana is ridiculous - its benign - and very much so in relation to alcohol. But a drug addict on meth is a criminal - he's not just endangering himself but all those around him - its reasonable for some drug to be illegal. I never assumed we should keep fighting the war on drugs at all - our drug laws do need a massive overhaul. I'd rather the guy who stole my bike get in trouble rather than the guy smoking a joint. Ever have a bike stolen - they do nothing about it.
