The entire drive to legalize marijuana is based on two core ideas:1. You can't OD on it, so it's not directly dangerous - people are responsible for their own actions, so there's not much reason for it to be criminilized2. It has *significant* applications to medicine, including FDA-approved drugs. Legalization allows for study, and more advancement in the pharmaceutical sciencesYou've kind of addressed the first point - but I think a discussion can be had on the role of government in regulating our own private behavior. There's a massive difference between jailing black kids for possession, and having so many kids in prison that they wait months for a trial, and prosecuting individuals who legally purchase marijuana and illegally distribute it. But you've not at all addressed the medicinal benefits - the FDA already has approved marijuana based drugs for child epilepsy (I believe it's epilepsy). There are preliminary studies which show THC as a compound which can treat cancer. It's worth looking into, but we can't if it's illegal. I also have an anecdotal story around "medicinal" marijuana. I suffered a major complex bone fracture in the arm, and it took weeks for the medical system to get its shit together and for me to get a surgery to fix it. During that time, illegally-obtained marijuana helped me manage both my pain and injury-related anxiety enough to *keep my job.* Without it, I more than likely would have lost my job, lost my income, been rendered unable to pay for medical bills, and probably would have slipped into poverty. Using doctor-prescribed oxycodone rendered me unable to work or drive, and taking nothing rendered me unable to *move.*
