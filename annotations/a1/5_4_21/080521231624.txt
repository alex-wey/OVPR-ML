I used to be a former drug addict and my drug of choice was weed. But it was all recreational for me of course and it led my down a bad path along with Xanax and lsd. Strangely enough I think alcohol should be illegal and a lot of people think I'm radical about that but honestly to much bad shit happens regaurding alcohol.. But I am all in favor for medical marijuana honestly. I would much rather have a. Patient of anxiety to use weed for anxiety than xanax. And weed does wonders for a lot of people with Parkinson's. But ever since I quit my drug abuse I find recreational not to be worth it for thbetter of people. The only thing good that comes from it is fun experiences. But how much fun is worth having countless people die to car accidents form illicit substances. How many domestic abuse cases are fueled by alcohol? Just more bad comes out of it that good for me. I am currently drunk right now which makes me sound like a god awful Hippocrate. But I'm currently in the process of slowing down and quitting, I'm also down to .5 of xanax a day Compared to my 6-20mg a day. Maybe I'm just biased because bad things have happened to me and I'm starting to wake up from alcohol and drug abuse and realize the bad isn't worth it.
