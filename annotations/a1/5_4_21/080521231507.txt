> Weed is not something that is bad for you to smoke or ingest. That's just innaccurate. There's a pretty decent list of short term & long term risks that come with smoking marijuana. [Source]()> 1) No one has the right to tell you not toAccording to the law they do. Unless you live in a part of the world where no laws oppose marijuana. But if a law opposes it then in the clearest way possible, there are people who have a right to tell you not to.> 3) It's not permanent so who cares? Seeing the point above, there is a risk for numerous long term issues.> If someone wants to wake 'n' bake or just stare at their ceilings and come up with ideas that are so stupid and then laugh at it later, what's wrong with that? Assuming a person is only responsible for themselves (IE no children) and also that they are able to take care of themselves, I agree. However, in many cases (at least those familiar to me), the wake & bake stoners are living off their parents or loved ones. In addition to having an honest understanding of the risks, it's important to have an honest look at who else this impacts. Specifically where those relationships are not easily dissolveable.
