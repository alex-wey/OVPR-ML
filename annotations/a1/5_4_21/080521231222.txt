Police profile because it makes their jobs easier, i. e. they are being lazy. In the case of stop and frisk, very few illegal weapons have actually been seized, which was the whole justification for the program in the first place. Most of the arrests are for misdemeanor amounts of marijuana and all racial groups use drugs, especially marijuana, at similar levels. The police just want to meet their arrest quotas and justify their continued employment, power, and funding, and they can easily do so by racially profiling young men for personal use amounts of marijuana. So, rather than going after real criminals actually hurting others, they are targeting specific racial groups for committing victimless crimes, while essentially giving the status quo group passes for committing the same crimes. Can you imagine how fast stop and frisk would disappear if police were targeting white kids? Furthermore, it's not necessarily that the poor commit crimes at higher rates, it's that they lack the means to properly defend themselves. Public defenders are overworked and interior to paid representation. When middle class or wealthy kids get caught with weed, they don't end up with criminal records which hurt their chances of employment and higher education. And this is where the white privilege comes in, as all white people, irrespective of economic status, are given a pass with stop and frisk, so only poor minorities end up suffering. Whites who would otherwise end up like poor blacks and Latinos end up avoiding harassment and arrests which ruin their lives simply because of their skin color.
