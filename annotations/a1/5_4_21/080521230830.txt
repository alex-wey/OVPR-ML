the whole idea that legalizing marijuana generates more revenue is the thesis of a *retard*. There's much more money to be made off an illegal substance that is worth as much as gold, and can be spun out of thin air if you have land and power. Retards don't see a tax on it, so they think legalizing it somehow creates wealth. These retards have thought about how much it costs TAXPAYERS for the drug war. But not about how much money it makes POLITICIANS using that taxpayer seed money for their class warfare and dirty tricks bag. The CIA without marijuana illegal, may be out of business. Millions of jobs would be lost, documented and undocumented, in addition to all the retail sector and restaurant sector that relies on people rich off the drug trade. We should legalize it, but don't debate using the logic of a retard. It should be legalized because the majority of the people want it legal, and we are taxed. no taxation without representationthe car your drug dealer buys wont get bought, the rehab center won't receive their grant, the cop on the marijuana task force will be collecting unemployement, the judges, the lawyers, all the related prison industry.. you have no clue how much of this is class warfare and has no foundation in democracy at all.
