That is disgusting. It makes sense that one of the true purposes of the War on Drugs is not to protect, but to gain political leverage. Cigarettes would not line up with that view; by making them illegal, the administration would gain nothing as everybody from all races and classes smoked cigarettes. The War on Drugs still going under the guise of public safety because that has always been its cover. Since cigarettes were not included in the original prohibition, it makes no sense to add them now... not that that is a feasible or likely option. Operating under the assumption that the War on Drugs was never truly about public safety and health, it is difficult to make a parallel between cigarettes and illegal drugs. In this case, I cannot say, "cigarettes are more dangerous than marijuana, why are cigarettes acceptable and marijuana stigmatized?"Marijuana and other illegal drugs were stigmatized to gain political leverage, not to reduce public drug use. There was no use stigmatizing cigarettes because they provided no political leverage even though they were as dangerous/more dangerous than other drugs. Though it is still ridiculous that the use of cigarettes is more acceptable than the use of illegal drugs, your explanation makes sense as to why our society ended up this way. Thank you!
