> you obviously haven't been on a college campus if you honestly believe that. Have *you* been to a college campus? I went to school from 09 - 12, and everyone had pot and didn't do much to hide that fact even though it is still illegal to possess. It was insanely easy to buy on campus. Controlling a substance never works, in principle, because anyone that wants it will go through illegal channels to get it anyway. The only real way to control a substance is be able to factually prove it is stupid to want to buy in the first place, without putting it behind artificial legal barriers to ownership, and let 99.99% of rational people realize its a stupid idea. You need to persuade people to not want it, not try pointing a gun at them saying "see this? DON'T TOUCH <controlled substance> OR I'LL SHOOT!" because anyone in that situation would dive for it as soon as you look away. Every illegal drug is an enticing forbidden fruit for anyone over the age of 13. Yet smoking is down astronomically as, instead of deeming it illegal (albeit buying cigs under 18 is illegal so there is a semblance of that forbidden fruit effect in high schools, and I *did* witness it during my time in one) you just show evidence that "hey, these things are just going to rot your lungs and throat. You probably have better things to do with your time".
