>I think behavioral control is rather more an unintended consequence of special interest groups legislating their interests than of any coherent effort to control behavior. I disagree. While I do not think that it is this specific behavior that the government seeks to control, the people who seek positions in government are mentally deranged and do so, overwhelmingly, out of a desire to exert control over other people - of any sort. What special interest group do you believe lobbied the Congressmen who passed the Controlled Substances Act? >If it were legal and regarded for what it is, a less harmful and less addictive alternative to alcohol. Jobs don't test you for alcohol, and don't fire you unless your drinking impacts your performance. Absolutely. >Once public opinion and the law come to terms with the facts on marijuana, I'm certain it will be treated similarly. Why do you have any hope whatsoever that this will ever be a possibility? Keep in mind that people have been dead certain legalization was right around the corner since the 60s. And also keep in mind that the government progressively removes freedoms from the public, and restoring them almost never happens for the same reason they don't allow states to easily vote themselves into independence. They would rather lose everything than lose control.
