>The fact that you brag about it kind of pisses me off. I didn't "brag" about it. I just said it is not as disorienting as many people believe. But it is not good to drive under any influence, I agree. I am human and have made mistakes.>Why do you think smoking weed suddenly gives you access to grow and produce? It doesn't. No, smoking weed doesn't give you access to grow it (never said that????). But applying for a license to grow it once it has become legal for recreational use does. Which is what I said.>I never said one thing about throwing you in jail over personal use. I just don't think it should be legalized and available for everyone. Then please, tell me, how do you propose to keep it illegal, and simultaneously not throw people in jail for it? Please, just answer this one question. If you don't think a decent citizen should go to jail for doing it in the privacy of their own home, how do you propose we also keep it illegal? Because last time I checked, people go to jail for breaking laws. Keeping it illegal means that having it would be against the law. Therefore, any decent citizen otherwise obeying all laws, would go to jail if the police were to find it in their house. Does this create cognitive dissonance for you? Do you have a solution to this paradox? I would love to hear it, if you do.*yep. that's what I thought. a downvote, and no answer. THINKING IS HARD I JUST DO WHAT DA TV TELLS ME TA DOOO
