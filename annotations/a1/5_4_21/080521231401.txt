Why have the government involved in a victimless crime? If I want to get high, why should your opinion have any effect on me?>For one, drugs generally fuck you up in the long term. There is safety in moderation. But if this is one of your points, why not ban something like junk food? Let's ban sitting too, that's not good for anyone's lumbar. Maybe we should ban something you enjoy that someone else thinks is unhealthy, TV? Internet posting? Why aren't you outside being as healthy as the government mandates? Oh right, it's a choice whether to be healthy or sit on my ass and get high.>And if you favour something like marijuana to be decriminalised: of course you would. You're high. Plenty of people who favor decriminalization for ethical, economic, or societal reasons.>Once you do drugs, you will never live a normal life ever again. Yeah, all those now moms and dads who were at woodstock are living such awful false lives, no children or homes. All those people living it up in the 60s are all homeless with bastard children. None of them are successful business owners or living sober average lives.>We have no problem looking down on those who smoke tobacco or those who drink alcohol - why do we act like other drugs are any different? They're not - they're just as, if not, more dangerous. Alcohol and Tobacco are some of the most dangerous, if not most dangerous drugs affecting the world, but drug criminalization is more of a political money making scheme than anything, so tobacco and alcohol reign. Weed was made illegal to have a reason to cripple minorities (orginally Mexicans). Weed was in use for thousands of years, and is proven to be safer than alcohol, tobacco, and even aspirin. Hell if we had a contest where you had to drink as much water as you could, and I had to smoke pot as much as I could, you would have a way higher chance of death.
