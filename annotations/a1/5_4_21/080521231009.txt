>The illegal drug trade is certainly the origin of a large number of killings, assaults, thefts, etc, although not all. And polygamy is certainly the origin of a large number of abuses within the FLDS, but not all of them.>The reason that banning drugs doesn't work is because people still want them, other people are willing to supply them and because it's an illegal trade other illegal measures are taken to protect it. And the reason that banning polygamy doesn't work is that people will still want to engage in it and because it's illegal other illegal measures are being taken to protect it. It's being driven underground and abuses are now much harder to shine light upon, just like with drugs.>Polygamy in FLDS is indoctrination from birth. So you want to paint polygamy as the problem in this situation rather than the people abusing the practice and indoctrinating their children? Much like people want to paint the drugs as the problem when someone who uses/sells them does something bad.>But I didn't say it should be legal or illegal, I said that I don't know that it could be done in a way that isn't harmful. The same logic is used by those who oppose legalizing drugs. "Oh, I'm not saying marijuana should or should not be legal, I just don't think you can do it in a way that isn't harmful."Your whole argument is easily morphed right into an argument against legalizing drugs. It's quite sad you can't see it.>To stay on the drug topic, if they were legal it would be because it's better for society, Maybe in your mind. Personally, I'd like to see them both legalized (polygamy and drugs) in the name of freedom and the right of people to do things in a responsible manner that in no way harm you or other people.
