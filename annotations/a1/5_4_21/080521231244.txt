Drinking laws in the US are ridiculous, here is Canada it varies 18-19 depending on the province you reside. In Europe I know it as low as about 13-14 and young children start to drink with their families at much younger age, wine with diner that sort of thing. In these countries there are fewer social problems associated with drinking. Just because a government labels something as bad, doesn't make it bad. In the US drugs are "bad", the "War on Drugs" causes more problems then it solves, it makes someone a criminal for a victimless crime. Parents tell their kids all drugs are equally bad, so they try Pot which really isn't that bad and say "hey this isn't really that bad, my parents must have been lying" So they go on to try worse drugs because their parents where being over protective and they where lied to not understanding the effects of different kinds of drugs. When I have kids I'll let them drink, I remember having a beer while fishing with my dad when I was about 13 or so. I drank with my friends when I entered high school. My parents purchased my alcohol for me, they knew that I would eventually end up drinking and rather I did it with their knowledge, knowing where I was, what I was drinking etc... I think that this is the best approach.
