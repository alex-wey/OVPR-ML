>we can't outlaw alcohol because its use is too widespread". The same could be said about marijuana, so shot down.>I can rattle off a list of the reasons why people want marijuana to be legal even though I don't agree with them. Why can't you do the same? Not the point. After taking a position and asked why, you literally have done nothing but refuse to respond.>Why are you afraid of even acknowledging arguments against your position exist? Where did I say they didn't exist? Why are you afraid of listing arguments against my position?>Why do you think it's okay to feign ignorance of other perspectives in order to lend credence to you own? This is coming from you, the guy who's reasoning is once again "IF UR SMART U NO". You rabble on about how you have to be smart enough to understand, but it appears that you aren't smart enough to understand because you can't list any reasons. It's a harmless plant vs. two things that directly and indirectly kill thousands a year and cost taxpayers more money than necessary, it's not that you have to be smart enough to be against marijuana, it's that you have to be so ignorant or so determined to ignore the facts. You wont be listing any more reasons after your first was shot down, we can all hope that one day you crawl out from under your rock and take a step into the real world, until that day, keep your mouth closed until you actually know anything.
