Seth Rogen last month released the first trailer for his next film, "The Interview," and it's nothing short of stunning. It's also a turn for Rogen.
But what did viewers say about it? Not according to Rogen. A lot of people still don't even know what he's talking about, and that's no accident.
"Well, it was kind of funny. I don't even know who's doing the suspension wire," he told People magazine about the film. "But it is an interesting kind of film. It's like, 'Get out of your house today.' "
The latest casting has also confirmed a well-known character that the comic actor has filled with a central role in the upcoming "Infamous: Second Son." Rogen acknowledged that he was more of a smoking weed in it than with the second draft of the film, but he said this to People magazine via email that "it's had no affect on my movie."
Indeed, he's been busy with the comedy routine side of "30 Rock," a role that he has filled for the last six years. Rogen took to the chatroom in January to discuss "The Interview," and most of the film feels like the kind of movie audience Reelz would enjoy watching.
And while he rarely performs in a film, fans of Rogen on the big screen can likely expect plenty of action and dialogue in this film.
As far as the film itself, Rogen is not going to admit that he was the guy who put Bruce Willis into the role of James Franco in the spoof "127 Hours" -- this is usually considered the remaking of a dumb joke. Rogen took to his Twitter feed this week to debunk his many jokes about the film, saying he hadn't seen the script yet.
With the cameo from Christopher Walken in the film, Rogen said he would probably play himself in "the movie."
