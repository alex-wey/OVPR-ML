Somehow Bret Michaels is having something of a family thing lately.
While touring in Denver a couple of months ago, the former Poison singer was busted for possessing five pounds of marijuana in a van, a motel room, and a health club. After police arrested him, both Michaels and his former manager were released on $2,500 bail, while Michaels was reported not guilty by reason of insanity.
This past week, Michaels took to his Facebook page to share a rather unexpected admission.
According to New York Magazine, Michaels just pulled his name in after arriving at the World Symphony of Music in August of 2009.
"I'm still not sure what to do about it, but I have been robbed because I'm an old ass douche and it would be a smashing hit if I had a release schedule," Michaels posted.
However, there is more. As soon as police raided his hotel room, he was at the wheel of a very unsafe and dangerous scooter.
"Over the holidays and on my way to work I forgot to change the bedrest. I slept in it two days in the morning."
The wheels were burning and finally broke in the nearly mile long scooter and busted for the purpose.
Along with taking to the blog (but no radio), Michaels had this to say about their night in the limousine:
