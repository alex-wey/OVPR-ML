One in three Americans strongly favored the legalization of marijuana, according to a Gallup poll released last Friday. The polls findings reveal another mixed bag of positive opinion of the federal marijuana prohibition; a third of all Americans think the federal government should maintain control of the legalized use of pot. Only 15 percent favor the legalization of marijuana, the second lowest level of personal autonomy versus civilian control.
Americans are split on the option of legalizing marijuana, an option proponents are reaching for as the name of marijuana legalization. A plurality of the public, though, seems to support the legalization of pot. Just 19 percent believe that the federal government should maintain control of marijuana.
Gallups poll shows a continuation of the publics attitude toward the federal governments handling of marijuana. While three in four Americans think that the federal government should preserve control of marijuana, only 20 percent say that the federal government should exercise the power to regulate this non-psychoactive drug. Five percent expect federal governments to collect fees and taxes on cannabis, but only 16 percent favor monetary control. Another 51 percent think that federal government should collect sales taxes. A third believes that criminalization of pot should be lifted, but just 11 percent will see it be increased.
Just 13 percent of Americans favor changing the speed limit at intersections, but two in three of those who think speeding at highways should be increased are opposed.
