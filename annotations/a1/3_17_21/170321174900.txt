One sufferer who was treated with a medical marijuana system was told that it was better than "hot shot."
A medication.
According to The New York Times, "Medical marijuana, while an affordable resource that many people have bought to treat diabetes and anxiety, was notorious for its inability to cope with pain without affecting quality of life, despite the unavailability of many legitimate drugs. But medical marijuana, which is legal for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, is a means of creating a safe alternative to hot shot."
