Colorado on Tuesday became the first state to legalize the possession and sale of marijuana for recreational use, in defiance of federal law. A similar measure in Washington state also appeared headed for voter approval. A third measure to remove criminal penalties for personal possession and cultivation of recreational cannabis was defeated in Oregon, where significantly less money and campaign organization was devoted to the cause. Supporters of a Colorado constitutional amendment legalizing marijuana declared victory and opponents conceded defeat after returns showed the measure garnering nearly 53 percent of the vote versus 47 percent against.
