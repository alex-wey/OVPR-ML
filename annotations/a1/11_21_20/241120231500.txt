"Gossip Girl" star Chace Crawford was busted in Florida for possession of marijuana Thursday.
Police issued a felony warrant for Crawford after he was spotted with a gun in the backyard of his home.
The 5-foot-8, 180-pound Crawford -- who appears in the TV series in a recurring role as Colleen DeFrancesco -- is reportedly wanted on a warrant alleging he sent a distress distress call to a 911 dispatcher the night before.
Authorities believe he had been fighting a fight with his neighbor, a former prisoner from Georgia who had arranged to meet Crawford to seek help for his wounds.
An investigation has been launched, but authorities have not provided any additional details about what occurred.
Crawford, who turns 21 next month, is no stranger to the big screen. His big screen film debut "Killer Confidential" starred as the great-grandson of Ben Affleck's character. He also did a cameo in the 1988 superhero film "Superman" for franchise producer Legendary Pictures.
"I have my own theories on what happened to Ben Affleck and Zach Galifianakis, and Galifianakis, and, more recently, Charlie Sheen," Crawford recently said of Sheen. "We do have theories, especially when it comes to Charlie and this whole fiasco. I think he's certainly worth the wait."
Crawford has had a series of problems recently including a second DUI last month. He spent the night at a drug rehab center in January after police came across him and taken him to jail for driving under the influence of alcohol and possessing cocaine.
