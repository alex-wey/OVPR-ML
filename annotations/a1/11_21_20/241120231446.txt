Discovery Channels scripted series Pot Cops is among seven shows revealed in a new trailer that details how drug laws affect the lives of thousands of law enforcement officers, as well as the cause of endangering the lives of others.
The show centers on officers who make sure they can keep an eye on residents of high-crime areas and witness the impact a drug enforcement crackdown has on drug users and the traffic in their neighborhoods.
Another program called The King of the Valley chronicles a crime crackdown in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez.
This is a nonfiction show with a full spectrum of topics, but you have to ask yourself: Can you guarantee that bad or no people are going to get in trouble so quickly? Lopez said in a news release.
The shows premiered earlier this week and are currently averaging 4.3 million viewers in their first season. The dramas are executive produced by TV writer-producer Liz Meyer and John Yentob. They developed the show with Ryan Reynolds.
