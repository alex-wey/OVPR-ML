Willie Nelson was fined a whopping $500 in legal fees when he pulled a carton of pot during an appearance at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival in Austin, Texas on Sunday.
The 45-year-old country singer was at the festival with musical guests Tinsley Mortimer and Dimitri Drazak after he visited a local dispensary. The guitarist joined the event of artists who went on to win awards and new beginnings in the music business.
It was a big deal, you know, for Willie Nelson to be named both a sponsor and the former, Ronnie Holte, associate professor of business at George Washington University told the Associated Press. We would have thought he would probably be in his 60s to become a Fortune 500 company. And he is.
Holte said his employer, Johnson & Johnson, has given Nelson away its retail stores.
Allard Nix, Nelsons manager, said Nelson pulled the carton as he normally does.
In an industry where someone would pull a carton of marijuana and no one would care, this clearly shows the damage done to someone, Nix said, adding that Nelson was fine.
Harte-Hanks said he expects the singer to pay up for the fine.
I think theres a chance that hell turn around and realize he was wrong, said Donald Fahey, VP and general manager at the Johnson & Johnson Drugstore and North American Sales business in Nashville.
Nelson was made aware of the fine earlier this week in accordance with Internal Revenue Service rules.
The singer was charged with grand theft over $125,000, misdemeanor drug possession, reckless driving and misdemeanor possession of marijuana.
Nelson is blacklisted from playing music and touring in the United States and Canada, where many artists are white, but that role is unknown. He is currently appearing on Oprah Winfreys The View on which he tells gay and transgender storytellers what is going on.
