Maneuvering dog vendor Gary Harvey, 22, was arrested Friday night for possession of marijuana and burglary during a recent burglary at a Long Island shelter, according to Nassau County officials.
Police say the moment of restraint a family nanny held the 2-month-old puppy and her 12-year-old stepfather captive in a car until the police arrived, the dog was well-circulated at the shelter and comfortably protected.
For more than five hours, police arrested Harvey, taken off life support and charged him with possession of an animal, burglary and criminal possession of a weapon, according to the Patch .
Maneuvering puppies arent dangerous animals. There isnt any evidence whatsoever of any kind, said Vernon Gardner, spokesman for the Nassau County Prosecutors Office. If the dog had been a pug or a pigeon, for that matter, we would have been watching it grow and grow and baby the puppy.
Earlier this month, residents on Hudson Street around Long Island received a letter for the litter of puppies, which contained the words Enough! The posting by the Long Island Humane Society read, Frantzed the sad story of the little one, an aggressive dog, were all the more deserving to be their home and take care of.
At this time, no charges have been filed against Harvey. The duo is being held without bail pending an official arraignment.
Despite the ghoulish risk that pets have when they are abused, the animal shelter does not condone animal abuse, Gardner said.
