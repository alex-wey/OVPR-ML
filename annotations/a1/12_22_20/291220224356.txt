A recent government pardon (yesterday's paper Talking Notes) suggests that an old judge shouldn't decide who gets to be the chief judge of a country. They are not part of the guidelines.
There are basically no rules governing how a person can legitimately opine on the constitution or policies of a country. And thus the federal guidelines are only applicable to court cases that are politically motivated.
When fighting for judges, you're more likely to be found wanting by the public prosecutor than the deputy chief judge of a state or city. A federal judge is only supposed to preside over a state or city case, even if he's a judge, meaning that he has the power to actually keep the drunk drunk drunk drunk drunk in a court, plus go through all the other things that the other judge presides over.
Sometimes it's just really hard to read a decision when the case is so obvious to everyone and the law is so clear that you can get away with making it happen.
There are indeed no rules relating to dropping the landmark ban on "office smokers"  and only a ban on substance abuse, if any. But that doesn't mean that all the people who are trying to pass the ban are ignoring the fact that it's an insulting choice. And regardless of the law, you probably don't know what you're getting into if you really want to succeed in the first place.
Good luck trying!
