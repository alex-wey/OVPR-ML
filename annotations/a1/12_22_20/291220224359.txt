As dutch guy living in one of the mentioned cities allow me to shed some light on this. Yesterday it was made public that the EU high court ruled that a "Wiet pas" was allowed according to EU 'law'. At the same day the city council of Maastricht made public that they were not in favor of the Wiet pas. Arguments where that criminal weed trade would appear in other area's in the outskirts and that the dealers could provide both hard and soft drugs (as stated in the article). The Wiet pas concerns mainly towns in the Netherlands that are close to a border. The mayors of these towns have the last say in this. The mayor of Eindhoven (my hometown) is in favor of the wiet pas in Eindhoven but with one strict condition;legalize the production of weed, also known as the illegal "back door" of a coffee shop. Make it controlled, a licensed activity, also eliminating the criminal activities. The mayor of Eindhoven wants to do this for Eindhoven, but until now this hasn't happened because it has national political consequences. The coalition of 3 parties that run the government are not all in favor of legalization of the back-door supply. However it has been noted that when the wiet pas is introduced, it will be a government sanctioned 'legal' document, so does that make wiet also a government sanctioned 'legal' drugs?2cts
