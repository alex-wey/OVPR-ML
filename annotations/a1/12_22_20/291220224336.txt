On film: A man based in San Francisco writes to many his fellow fans in support of a people rights movement that is building on the ban on a completely drug based medical marijuana dispensary, for everyone to see. Eileen Cormier says, "All hell is breaking loose if this guy sets up shop in Santa Clara County. And the liberal-conservative crowd very much hate this guy. And they're fighting back. At least it's nice that we now have a consensus on this issue."
A man based in San Francisco says he's got plenty of fans for an issue that concerns him personally "because I want to bring a concern about underage people with us to a greater extent." Josh Chilton agrees, "The end of age-old drugs that we just used, like alcohol or those awful painkillers (and on that your kids take less medication because of the pain) and then giving it to people that are made up of people that have been careless with the abuse, and sharing them along with us so that we know who we're dealing with. The end of everything and to me it's not a medical problem."
