Agree, I usually get quite an odd look from people when I say we need to legalize more than just weed. However, they often overlook the other possibilities as to why we should legalize more than just weed. Particularly, the big two in my opinion, have nothing to do with raising money for the USFG. First, despite what the legal system actually says, the illegality establishes a stigmatization upon users that typically makes them fear seeking help or aid for their problem because they don't want to face legal consequences. This is my biggest concern, because even though I personally believe all drugs are safe in moderation, as long as we keep it illegal we undermine the ability for many people to seek the help that they need or desire. Sure, it may be because of their ignorance, but we aren't going around telling them "it's okay, we will help you if needed", instead we are persecuting them to the fullest extent of the law and throwing them in prison rather than provide them with aid. Second, the reason why there is any drug violence is because of the cartels and the underground market in itself. Will it sure exist? Sure, just like the moonshining business still exists. But it will be immensely weaker than it currently is, to the point where it is hardly noticeable at all by people. Undermining the providers and producers really begins to stop the violence associated with drug use. So, why do we have drugs illegal? Because of the violence associated and to help people avoid the risk of addiction. However, I don't know anyone that is going to randomly decide to become a cocaine addict just because cocaine is legal. So the argument that legalization opens access to more users is ridiculous to me. But what are we really doing? We are increasing violence and undermining the ability for many to get help. The only way to truly accomplish our goals behind the drug war is to abolish the drug war altogether.
