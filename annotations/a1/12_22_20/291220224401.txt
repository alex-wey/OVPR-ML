> Obama took our country to war without a declaration from Congress, then watched coolly as the sixty day limit in the War Powers Act came and went. You say that, and yet the Republican Congress has done absolutely nothing to stop him. Almost as though this is an empty and baseless allegation that ignores the authority the Presidency has already been assigned through numerous other authorizations of military force.> His health care legislation is being implemented in spite of a federal judge ruling it unconstitutional. The judge ruled it unconstitutional but failed to issue an injunction against the law. If he doesn't issue an injunction, the law continues implementation while it remains under appeal. Of course, there are more appellate courts that have found the legislation constitutional than unconstitutional... It's also worth noting that Judicial Review is - itself - (and you're going to laugh at this) UNCONSTITUTIONAL! you're really complaining that a judge with no Constitutional authority to stop a law from coming into effect stopped a law from coming into effect without explicitly stating he was doing so and accomplished this by exercising a power the Constitution doesn't grant him. :-p It is to laugh!> His administration has continued to raid medical marijuana facilities in states where it has been legalized, violating the Tenth Amendment. So you support Judicial Review (which does not exist in the Constitution) but oppose the Interstate Commerce Clause (which does exist in the Constitution)? Are you sure you're reading the US Constitution? Perhaps this is the confusion. I'm in the United States of America. What country are you in?> Separation of powers is a myth. A myth. This country is a dictatorship and has been at least since Lincoln, if not since Washington. I am living on Earth. The third planet from the sun. What planet are you living on?
