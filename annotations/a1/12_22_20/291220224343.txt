Thanks for the love! Same to you! I'm not totally sure what the laws are like in Beirut, but I willtell you what it would be like if you were coming to Saudi. First of all, as a girl, it would be next to impossible for you to find weed. Hash would be more likely but even then, extremely rare. In Saudi Arabia it's so illegal you could get your head cut off for the right amount. Especially if you area foreigner they might suspect you of smuggling. Keep in mind that here, most women are supposed to see their lives as a priviledge afforded to them by men, (which in a lot of situations, is financially the case) You might get lucky here and there, but most likely from some dude who wants to get into your pants. Chances are you are better of just giving it a rest for a while- I had to and it went better than expected. I dont fiend or suffer from cravings since I know it's just impossible to get at the moment. Just pick up a hobby, (I started making electro music :  ) and that keeps me comfortably busy. Take it as an opportunity to quit smoking and healthy up your lungs a bit. I didn't notice a huge difference in my quality of life, but I no longer feel out of breath which is definitely a plus in such a hot country! Most of all, don't freak out, you'll enjoy yourself no matter what the situation is. Peace and Love! -J
