This isn't "my buddies." Like so many others in my region, this isn't about our friends and their three plants in their closet. It's about our families. Our friend's families. I already said I support legalization. Just don't try to make it a black and white issue. That being said, notice that your little joke about their new income is something else that would be a crime. You have one blanket statement over an issue that is profoundly complex and intricate. What are the FDA regulations on marijuana? Where will it be grown, regionally? Import, export, relations with with countries that don't support legalization. Relations with countries that do. Relations with countries whose economic models are in part based off illegal drug trade, how will it affect them. What kind of price index are we talking, because that's entirely regional at the moment. I want to see it legalized. I don't want it in the hands of the corporations. What needs to be changed is the overall perception of drugs in this country, and you can't legislate that anyway. Many many people's livelihood is based on it. Many good people, completely separate from mainstream drug trade, rely on it, because if they didn't absolutely have to do it, they wouldn't. It's dangerous, they risk themselves and the wealth of their families on it. They wouldn't do that if they had another choice. Thanks for your narrow view of something so conceptually open to interpretation, and your assumption that this market is only open for the middle class that want to make a little extra money on the side.
