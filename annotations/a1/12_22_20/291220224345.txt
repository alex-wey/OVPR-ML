I agree, although the low approval ratings and "taboo"-ness of the subject are fueled not by people's hatred of the drug, but their half formulated opinions based on the shoddy science being produced. When entities such as Above The Influence are active in their campaigns they readily miseducate young children about drug use. For a school project I took their page on Marijuana and looked at every word on the page (read the citations too) and found 6 full pages of error and outdated/disproven theories published. If the education on the subjects was up to date and correct, there would be very little opposition to the legalization of Cannabis (perhaps other drugs too). An example I am going to use is the British Lung Foundation's recent publication where they claim that Marijuana usage causes cancer to be 20(?) times more likely in the user's lungs. The study references various sources but fails to cite many updated or currently accepted studies. In addition to this, two major studies done with appropriate sample sizes came to an adverse conclusion. Even worse, the BLF cannot confirm a single case where marijuana caused lung cancer, but they can produce plenty where Tobacco did (their counter-variable). Not to mention they fail to provide any evidence for their claim. After long pages of data and scientific rambling a conclusion is poorly jumped to. Studies like that are what cause the anti-drug sentiment in the US, England, and the United Nations (SOCHUM).
