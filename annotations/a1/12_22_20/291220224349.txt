Ok, they just have a different view of drugs. Maybe they are wrong. Humans have been consuming psychedelics forever, other cultures praised them. I think you just need to educate yourself on the fact that drugs do not just make their users losers. Drugs power art and music. Drugs have helped tons of cultures. Shamans have been eating mushrooms and not ruining societies for thousands of years. Drugs have good potential, you just have learned otherwise from a campaign that has motives that are NOT protection people. Steve Jobs dropped acid, Obama smoked weed, every musician has done pretty much everything, buisnessmen and hollywood people do coke, drugs don't just make people into losers and it is a ignorant stereotype to think that they do not help a lot of people. The horrible fuck ups are covered, the people doing it responsibly aren't talked about. I would go ahead and argue drugs do wonders for society. Psychedelics are an excellent mind expanding tool. Alcohol has probably been present at every important affair since the dawn of time. Ketamine has been shown to treat depression. MDMA has excellent therapeutic value for things like PTSD. Drugs are wonderful for some peoples mental health, and if it is not it is not because of the drug but the reason for using it. What is making it bad is the ignorance that is perpetuated by their illegality. People are doing stupid doses, people are doing drugs in a way that harm themselves because they do not know how to do it right because of the illegality. Explain to me why, exactly, drugs are so bad. Cocaine and weed used to be legal, opiates used to be in kids cough medicine, and the world didn't fall apart into unproductive nonsense.
