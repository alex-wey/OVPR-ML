Pharma: it will not stop those drugs from being used. Pot is not the same thing as Prozac or Zoloft. While marijuana definitely has medical benefits it is not a wonder drug. It's also not as potent as some pharmaceuticals. Look at caffeine and amphetamines, just because the former is freely available doesn't mean the latter has no medical purpose, because while they share some similar effects they are really completely different drugs. Lumber: I found it hard to find real figures but taking one country as an example, Canada, I managed to determine that in 2001, the paper & pulp industry was worth about 18 billion and the rest of the wood industry (boards, panels, etc.) was about 13 billion. Certainly a massive shift towards hemp paper (which is great stuff) would harm the industry, but certainly not cripple it. Textile: Cotton is by far the most produced textile. Canvas would not be replaced, it is mostly made from cotton. You know that cotton is already incredibly cheap, right? Hemp wouldn't shake up the market that much. Alcohol: All of the pot smokers I know still drink (myself included). They are different things entirely. Pot will not replace wine, it will not replace beer, it will not replace liquor. Or have you forgotten that many Western countries have already banned or have begun to ban smoking in restaurants and bars? Chemicals: Yeah, but it won't cripple the industry, it'll help it or nothing. Biofuel: Hemp is worthless for biofuel when you compare it to algae.
