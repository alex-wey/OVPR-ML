WASHINGTON  The Department of Veterans Affairs is planning to phase out using 25,000 veterans prescriptions to treat wounds from the December fall attack by the Taliban against the U.S. Armys prison camp in Afghanistan.
That means that until the unit receives an adequate supply of the pills, it will be unable to administer them.
Further, if vets-on-us receive a prescription for four prescription opioids, the VA says it will not allow them to use them while in Afghanistan. The Army said, as well, that veterans will not be able to take all four or five prescriptions a week to treat wounds such as PTSD and other mental illnesses.
So the VA is cutting off access to addiction services to treat veterans with several forms of mental illnesses, including addiction to opioids.
After last weeks deadly terrorists attack on US embassies and synagogues in Kenya and Tanzania, the staff at the VA has requested that, beginning July 1, 12,000 veterans will be able to be treated. The agency announced that it will put the groups liability insurance up to $20 million.
Veterans who lost their lives in the war will get an additional $14 million while the administration predicts that 1.5 million veterans will receive treatment for lost limbs, despite the care they now receive in hospitals in the military-run facilities around the country.
