Robert Garrigus, who finished in a tie for third at the U.S. Open at Congressional Country Club recently, said he and other golfers used to smoke marijuana while they were on the course playing in Nationwide Tour. Garrigus, 33, went through a rehab program as he battled substance abuse issues early in his career. As a player the Nationwide Tour, the PGAs developmental circuit, he and other golfers would sneak off to smoke often in portable toilets. Oh, yeah, there were plenty of guys on the Nationwide Tour who smoked in the middle of the round, Garrigus told Golf Digest . We always talked about it. You could go in the Porta John and take your drags. Garrigus said his drug use was limited and began during college at Arizona. The PGA began drug testing in 2008. It was all golf and partying, he said. I never did hard drugs. I never did coke or LSD. It was just smoking and drinking and hanging out with friends. The smoking got to be habitual: five, 10, maybe 20 times a day. I didn't keep track of how much. I constantly needed to be high. And I took it to the max. Every single day. Mostly just smoking, smoking, smoking.
