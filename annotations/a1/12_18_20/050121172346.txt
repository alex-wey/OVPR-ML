Robert Garrigus of the U.S. leaves the final round of the Pinehurst Champions event ahead of the seventh PGA Championship.
Two-time PGA champ Robert Garrigus thought about, smoked weed on the outskirts of Augusta, Georgia. He believes he and other golfers would be better off by going down a different road if that wasnt the case.
Garrigus had a great experience of playing the Nationwide Tour last year, winning the George Washington Invitational in impressive fashion, and hes slowly beginning to feel more comfortable with some of the more rough courses.
In the first qualifying round in his final swing of the third round of his Nationwide Tour event on Wednesday, Garrigus did just enough not to drop 20 shots  all but one of them tied for the lead  but then fell further behind.
As Darren Clarke revealed, the shot that finally got Garrigus to his feet would have been his hole-in-one at the par-3 14th. The next closest putt came at the 17th, and a bogey at the last dropped Garrigus into a tie for 39th. That put him at 13 over in an even-par 64, a score that has him still in danger of missing the cut in his final two events.
Then again, it would have been good for Garrigus to not get behind Clarke. On Sunday, a 61-foot eagle putt at the last was sufficient to reach a tie for 50th, but today the two-time South African Cup winner stopped making birdies and made three more birdies, and it was a playoff.
