Colorado is gettingslapped with morelawsuits over its decision to legalize marijuana. Two months ago, Oklahoma and Nebraska filed a complaint with the Supreme Court, arguingthat Colorados regulations violate the U.S. Constitution. Now, Safe Streets Alliance, an anti-crime group led by a Reagan-administration veteran, is bringing forward two moresuits in federal court. Safe Streets Chairman James Wootton, who according to his Web sitebiography served in in the Reagan Justice Department, had already thrown his support behind the Oklahoma and Nebraska lawsuit this month. The president has both the moral andconstitutional obligation to stop this failed experiment by enforcing federal laws which prohibit the legalization of pot, he said at the time , while also unveiling a national petition to ask President Obama to do as much. The lawsuits echo that claim. In one, Safe Streets and Colorado property ownersPhillis Windy Hope Reilly andMichael P. Reilly are suing a handful ofmarijuana industry participants under federal racketeering laws and state and local officials under the charge that they are violating the constitutions supremacy clause by not enforcing federal law. The suit from Oklahoma and Nebraskasimilarly argued that latter point. In the other suit , Safe Streets joined withNew Vision Hotels Two, LLC, which owns the Holiday Inn in Frisco, Colorado to sue a handful of members of the marijuana industry on racketeering charges. New vision is suffering injuries to its business and property caused by the operations ofSummit Marijuana, a state-licensed recreational marijuana store that plans to open less than 75yards from the front entrance of New Visions hotel, they write in their suit. Legalization advocates preempted the unveiling of the Safe Streets suits on Thursday with their own planned press conference, suggesting in a statement that they have little faith the suits will succeed.
