A lot of your argument seems to be based on a comparison between marijuana and other drugs. But the problem is, most drugs aren't comparable to marijuana. You suppose that heroin would gain a level of illegal production to match what marijuana's has become, and I just can't wrap my head about why you think that might be. There aren't many heroin or meth users out there developing a hobbyist's interest in producing their drug. &#x200B;Or the idea that use of heroin or meth will maintain or increase at legalization, and I certainly don't believe that. The crowd that isn't doing meth and heroin aren't avoiding it because of legal repercussions. &#x200B;While legal marijuana almost definitely increased the rate of marijuana DUI cases, I find it a similarly hollow claim that heroin and meth users would cause more DUIs if it was legal. Perhaps some, but again, marijuana isn't like meth and heroin. Marijuana DUI cases are likely as high as they are because it's so easy for so many to get away with it. I don't necessarily believe that there's going to be thousands of meth heads mixed into my traffic if they only thing they have to fear is a DUI. &#x200B;Nor can the War on Drugs take credit for ancillary crimes found when chasing drugs. They would still be illegal, and we'd all agree it still should be pursued and stopped. There's no reason to think cops are powerless unless they are chasing drugs.&#x200B;At the end of the day though, none of it touches on the real true failings of the War on Drugs. In the world of narcotics law enforcement, there aren't victims. There are users and dealers. Treating drug addiction like a health problem and trying to solve it as such is proven to be more effective than punitive punishments, and you simply cannot balance a medical approach while at the same time pursuing criminal charges against drug users. Legalizing all drugs isn't going to solve the drug problem, it's a necessary first step to solutions that actually work.
