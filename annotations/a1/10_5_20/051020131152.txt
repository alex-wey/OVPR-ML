I'm not saying that marijuana businesses won't succeed. I said that the economy won't tremendously improve once it becomes illegal. There's a fine difference between those two statements. Breweries don't just hand out beer to their employees. That's a no brainer. They're selling that product for a profit, and employees also know that drinking on the job at a vast majority of places would get them fired. And marijuana businesses don't operate just fine. Just like every other work place there are a lot of bad things going on behind the scenes. Your local news can tell you more about that. Also, are you trying to suggest that marijuana alone is the determining factor of crime rates? That's a straw man argument and an incredibly narrow minded statement. There are far more factors than a single substance that can determine that. Also, [Washington's marijuana related crime rates are unchanged]() despite how they legalized it. Once again, a simple news lookup can tell you that. And if you actually continued to read the entire site, there are clear long term effects listed as well. How can I expect to have a logical and sound argument with you when you cherry pick your evidences and twist your opponent's evidences and words. Until you change this, I refuse to continue debating with you. Goodbye.
