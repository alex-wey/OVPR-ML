I have to agree about the constant slew of studies that come up with new health benefits. Seems a bit fishy to me. Groups that fund studies usually have an agenda, and that alone is enough to skew studies towards finding results they deem desirable. It goes either way, a pro marijuana organization isn't going to pay for clinical trials that they think will show harmful benefits of cannabis consumption. It does have proven health benefits though, It's nausea, pain, and anxiety reducing qualities alone are enough for most to consider it medically valuable. With the rate that opiates and other dangerous drugs are getting doled out to people I don't see anyway you can consider that okay but scoff at marijuana being medicine That said, I think as far as drugs go marijuana is the lesser of all evils. Alcohol and tobacco have a long track record of being more harmful in terms of health and domestic violence, alcohol especially seems like something society could do without. If somebody out there smokes a joint and watches TV instead of drinking a fifth and starting a fight I would consider that a good thing. People are always going to want to get high and alter their consciousness and weed seems to be the safest way to do that at this point in time. Legalizing it just takes money from the cartels and back to the people, in the form of taxes and small business. Marijuana being illegal didn't really stop people from smoking, just like prohibition didn't stop alcohol consumption. Allowing the government to regulate the industry makes sure you know what you are smoking, as well.
