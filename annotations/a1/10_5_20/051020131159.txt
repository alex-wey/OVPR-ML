I dont think I can convince you that its wrong to legalize, decriminalize weed and I wouldnt try. It probably would be better for the country. A better argument would be the country would be a better place as a whole if inebriating drugs (booze, weed, etc.) didnt exist at all. I know its a silly hypothetical, but if I could go back in time, I would probably be a (slightly) better person today if it werent for the influences of weed, getting drunk and other drugs. This probably applies to most people. For some people they would be completely different if they were only sober. You could even make an argument that inebriating drugs dont improve people in any way really (besides for medicinal purposes). Parties wouldnt be as fun, but thats it. But its hard to argue that in this universe that weed should be illegal considering all the damage the drug war has caused, the havoc its wreaked on the global population, the incarceration rates, the violence, the lies and misinformation. The only possibly valid arguments Ive heard have cited flawed studies, incorrect statistical analysis, and outright lies. Anyway, yeah it would be ultimately good for the country but if we didnt have any of it, it would probably be better for everyone.
