Williams went from homeless to gainfully employed after video of his radio perfect voice went viral. But as the recovering drug and alcohol addicts past was revealed, the story quickly went from uplifting to something a little sadder in only two weeks. Williams was arrested, but not charged, in January after he and his daughter argued in a Los Angeles hotel. The next day he admitted he wasnt sober on the Dr. Phil show and entered rehab. Now his story is taking another familiar turn: hes currently filming a reality show . Do the viewers who make these average people Internet celebs hold some responsibility for their fates?

Ortenzi,06-02-2011,,"Are we winning the war on drugs? Nope. While thats not a direct quote, it seems to summarize the conclusions of a high-level commission that aims to rethink global drug policies. In a new report , the group recommends legalization of marijuana and calls for drug policies guided by health care and human rights -- not criminal justice. The groups conclusions are the latest challenge to Americas war on drugs. The way Global Commission on Drug Policy sees things, democracy is threatened by the corruption and violence connected with the drug trade and U.S. efforts arent helping things. The debate is particularly hot in Mexico, where drug cartels selling to the American users have led increasingly brazen attacks on fellow citizens in an attempt to maintain profits and fear. Some already wonder if Mexico is a failed state . Its an awkward time for the war on drugs. While federal officials have maintained their stance -- under both Republican and Democratic administrations -- state governments and voters have been approving new medical marijuana laws that are at odds with federal ones . Even the changing political tides seem to be working against the war on drugs. The rise of Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tx.) and other libertarians like fellow 2012 candidate Gary Johnson reflect a portion of American society that seeks less government intervention in the lives of citizens. Did you catch Ron Pauls take on heroin at the last GOP debate?"

A judge has rejected a plea deal that would have Nelson plead guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia and pay a $500 fine. The country music legend was arrested in November after six ounces of marijuana were found on his tour bus. The deal was rejected Wednesday by Judge Becky Dean-Walker, who told the AP that Nelson should be charged with misdemeanor marijuana possession. The red-headed stranger could face a year in jail if convicted. This seems like a harsh turn in a case where an attorney said Nelson could get off with a fine if he sang Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain . Sadly, Dean-Walker later said the offer was a joke that got out of hand. This is not the first time Nelson, who has appeared on multiple High Times covers and in the 1998 film Half Baked, has been arrested for marijuana-related crimes. He was sentenced to six months probation for a misdemeanor count of marijuana possession in 2007."

Narcotics investigators for the Metropolitan Police on Monday began visiting stores where they said they had previously made undercover buys or learned of sales of synthetic marijuana, said Inspector Brian Bray, commander of narcotics and special investigations. Another three convenience stores are set to receive visits, Bray said. The product is not illegal under District law or under state law in Maryland, although there have been proposals to outlaw it in both places. Virginia recently banned synthetic marijuana. Spice cannot be detected by current urine testing methods and has become popular among military members, parolees and probationers who face random drug checks, said Bray. Eleven midshipmen have been expelled since January from the U.S. Naval Academy for using or possessing Spice in what is described as an ongoing investigation. On March 1, the Drug Enforcement Administration banned five chemicals that are used to treat herbs to make them mimic the effects of marijuana. The DEA is empowered to put a substance temporarily in Schedule I to avoid an imminent threat to public safety and acted, its spokesmen said, after increasing reports from emergency room doctors of convulsions, elevated heart rates and anxiety attacks among other side effects. At the time of the DEA ban, 16 states had outlawed the herbal mix, which often is packaged in foil envelopes and labeled as incense. Bray said it is selling in the District for about $40 a gram. Users in the District could be prosecuted due to the DEAs action, but it likely would be a minor drug case for federal court, said Bray, which is why investigators are focusing on putting stores on formal notice they stand to forfeit business assets for selling and distributing products containing the banned chemicals. In addition to Spice and K2, the fake pot is sold as Wicked X, Bliss, Black Mamba, Bombay Blue, Fake Weed, Genie, Blaze, Dream, Ex-Ses, Spark, Fusion, Dark Knight, Yucatan Fire, Sonic, AK-47, Atomic Orange and Zohai."

After Tampa police pulled over the 27-year-olds orange Chevy Camero early Thursday, Dukes tried to eat a small bag of marijuana , as first reported by the Tampa Tribune. Dukes was charged with drug possession, tampering with physical evidence, possession of drug paraphernalia and three counts of driving with a canceled or suspended license. He was not, however, cited for watching Super Troopers one too many times. According to records obtained by the Tribune, Dukes has been arrested dozens of times since 2001, including charges related to domestic violence and failure to pay child support. The Tampa Bay Rays selected Dukes in the third-round of the 2002 draft. He was released by Washington in 2010 after spending two up-and-down seasons with the Nationals. Last February, Dukes began rapping under the name Fly Eli, and in a Tampa Tribune story, said he would sometimes smoke marijuana before Nationals home games. Dukes also said he felt he had been blackballed by baseball after he came forward alleging fellow players were smuggling drugs onto chartered planes and using them in their hotel rooms. Major League Baseball refuted Dukes claims . Dukes, who has six children with four different women, was suspended in each of his first five professional seasons."
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/mike-debonis/post/vincent-orange-proposes-capping-dc-marijuana-sites/2012/01/12/gIQAhiqMuP_blog.html,washingtonpost.com,Vincent Orange proposes capping D.C. marijuana sites,Mike DeBonis,01-12-2012,,"Well, Vincent Orange said hed fill the leadership void in Ward 5 during the months it will go without a D.C. Council member . His void-filling has wasted no time. Orange informed his colleagues today that hes proposing an emergency bill that will place limits on the number of medical marijuana facilities that can go in any particular ward. He would like a vote as soon as next Tuesday. Under the draft bill circulated Thursday by Orange, only five marijuana cultivation centers could be permitted in any single ward. As for dispensaries, where medical pot would actually be retailed, Orange aims to limit those to only two per ward. Also, if a ward has five or more cultivation centers, no dispensary could locate there. This is of particular interest to Ward 5, where most marijuana entrepreneurs are looking to open up their facilities as documented by DCist and the Washington Times. Orange represented the ward from 1999 to 2007. Former council member Harry Thomas Jr. had pondered a similar bill late last year, but, as it turned out, he had other matters to attend to . Many Ward 5ers including several who spoke at an Orange-hosted meeting Monday arent too jazzed about the prospect of legalized drug facilities, as theyre already quite annoyed about the concentration of strip clubs and other unsavory businesses in the ward. But theres a reason for that: Zoning restrictions keep many of those businesses from locating elsewhere in the city. Ward 5, with its relative surfeit of industrially zoned land and relative deficit of schools and other facilities that complicate the location of said unsavory businesses, just happens to be the main place these folks can legally go. There is nothing in the Orange bill that would address that problem, meaning the bill could be a de facto cap on the number of medical marijuana facilities above and beyond the caps contemplated in Health Department regulations (10 cultivation centers and five dispensaries). Update, 5:45 p.m..: Orange said hes not stopping with marijuana facilities; hes also aiming to cap the number of strip clubs, topless bars, gentlemens clubs, or adult entertainment establishments in a separate piece of legislation. I promised the Ward 5 leadership I was going to get this done, he said. A West Virginia Avenue NW establishment, Club AKA 55, has declared its intention to feature nude dancing, and Orange says he wants to nip the issue in the bud, as it were. If youre going to have a discussion on the cultivation centers and dispensaries, you might as well have a discussion on strip clubs as well, he said. Regarding the marijuana facilities, Orange said hes hoping his colleagues would see this oversaturation is unfair. For emergency legislation to pass, Orange needs nine votes out of 12. Asked whether he intends to address the zoning restrictions that are most responsible for said oversaturation, Orange said, that may be the product that comes out of this legislation. If its still determined 10 cultivation centers are needed, he said, maybe someone will present legislation to relax zoning regulations. What about Orange himself? Not at this point, he said."

But before long its going to get much bigger, moving into the electoral arena around the country and forcing itself into national debates in a way it hasnt been before, much as same-sex marriage did over the last few years. Were rapidly approaching the day when no politician with any significant ambitions can avoid having a well-considered position on the issue. Would-be public officials are going to be asked about it with increasing frequency, and it wont be enough to make a Cheech and Chong joketo change the subject. That isnt stopping them from trying, however. When Chris Christie got asked about legalization on his radio show, he said : For the people who are enamored with the idea with the income, the tax revenue from this, go to Colorado and see if you want to live theresee if you want to live in a major city in Colorado where theres head shops popping up on every corner and people flying into your airport just to come and get high. To me, its just not the quality of life we want to have here in the state of New Jersey and theres no tax revenue thats worth that. Officials from the rancid cauldron of sin and misery that is Colorado were quick to respond . From the beauty of the rolling hills of the Eastern Plains to the magnificent landscapes in the mountains and from our smallest rural towns to our largest cities, Colorado offers the greatest quality of life in the nation, said Senator Michael Bennett. A lot of people think Colorado is great place to live, work and play. Plus, we have a pretty awesome quality of life, said a spokesperson for Governor John Hickenlooper. Obviously, those guys must be high. This is something of a preview of the arguments well see as we move toward 2016 and legalization initiatives are on ballots all over the country. Youll notice that Christies argument was pragmatic, not moralistic. He didnt say that people who smoke pot are losers and criminals, or that its an instrument of evil. Instead he talked about the trade-offs between tax revenue and the vitality of urban shopping districts. Opponents of legalization realize that moralistic arguments against marijuana are going to be political losers, what with the fact that a majority of Americans now support legalization , plus the fact that most Americans have used it at some point in their lives . But that doesnt mean Republicans are going to come around to legalization any time soon,a factDemocrats hope will allow them to use ballot initiatives to burst turnout among some of their target constituencies. To be sure, this fall there may end up being only a couple of marijuana initiatives on the ballot. Florida voters will decide on a constitutional amendment providing for medical marijuana, and a full legalization initiative could make it to the ballot in Alaska . Advocates are also trying to put a measure on the ballot in Oregon . But if youre a legalization advocate,you actually shouldnt want to have an initiative on the ballot this year. In state after state, advocates have decided to wait until 2016, when they know more of Democrats and young people will be going to the polls to vote for president, to put the question to the voters. Advocates in California considered mounting a push this year, then put it off until 2016 . That presidential year could also see initiatives in Arizona, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, and Nevada, and possibly other states as well. Theres a good reason for this: Polls show huge divides by age and party on theissue. Recent surveys by the Pew Research Center show that while only 32 percent of Americans over 65 favor legalization, 70 percent of those 18 to 29 favor it. The divide between parties is only slightly smaller, with 63 percent of Democrats favoring legalization compared to 39 percent of Republicans. With half a dozen or more states deciding legalization at the polls in 2016, it will be impossible for any politician to ignore. And after years of fruitful hippie-bashing, Republicans will find themselves increasingly on the defensive. And this issue is only going to get bigger and bigger."

With recently passed legalization laws going into effect in Colorado , and reports that New York is planning on loosening its marijuana laws, the best we can hope for is that these laws are written in a way that will protect the innocent as much as possible. Soon well be seeing the first reports of crime resulting from the marijuana business the DUIs, problems with underage access, etc. These are already problems associated with alcohol. Without question, we will face more human tragedy and ruined lives as a result of marijuana legalization. Tyler Williams of Blanchester, Ohio, selects marijuana strains to purchase at the 3-D Denver Discrete Dispensary on Jan. 1. Its not good policy to facilitate the opportunity for more inebriated people to wander among us. Legalizing marijuana is just not a good idea. Even my friend Ruth Marcus at XXX, who is not exactly a conservative commentator, said that widespread legalization is a bad idea, particularly because of the known negative impact smoking marijuana can have on adolescents and their development. She cited a 2012 study that found that persistent cannabis use was associated with neuropsychological decline broadly across domains of functioning. Republicans need to be clear on where they stand on this issue.We shouldnt think up reasons to do the wrong thing to try to look hip or appeal to reckless youth. If the Democrats think they have found an issue for 2014, let them be the ones to promise more pot to the population. And spare me the talk about personal freedom being at stake here. You arent more free if you are a pothead and freedom isnt measured by marijuana consumption."

The summary, which Attorney General Kamala Harriss (D) office releases for each proposed ballot measure, says the state would save in the low hundreds of millions of dollars annually on law enforcement costs associated with enforcing marijuana laws. As an added bonus, Harriss office said sales tax revenues could add more cash again, in the low hundreds of millions of dollars annually to the states bottom line. Supporters of the proposed ballot measure would need to collect 504,760 signatures by May 23 to get the initiative formally known by its ballot title, Marijuana Legalization. Initiative Statute on the 2014 ballot. The group backing legalization wont actually be collecting signatures for this version of the bill; the lead sponsor told the San Francisco Chronicle that they had tweaked the initiatives language to allow individuals to grow more marijuana for personal use. A revised version [pdf] of the ballot initiative, dubbed the Marijuana Control, Legalization and Revenue Act of 2014, is scheduled to be reviewed by the attorney generals office by the end of January, the Chronicle reported. Both versions of the measure would legalize the use, growth, cultivation, possession, transportation, storage and sale of marijuana, while creating a commission to regulate and issue business licenses for cultivation and sales. The measure would apply retail sales taxes to marijuana sold for recreational purposes, while allocating that money equally to education, health care, law enforcement and drug abuse programs. It also prevents state and local law enforcement officials from enforcing federal marijuana laws. Some California officials who back marijuana legalization had urged fellow supporters to wait until 2016, when the electorate will be larger, younger and more ethnically diverse, to put a measure on the fall ballot. But the ballot summary is so favorable that strategists think they will be able to pass the measure even in the lower-turnout midterm year. California has been in the vanguard of the pro-marijuana movement. The state was the first in the country to legalize the possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes, back in 1996. In 2010, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) signed legislation decriminalizing possession of an ounce or less. If the ballot measure passes, California would be the third state to legalize marijuana, along with Washington and Colorado, where voters legalized the drug through ballot measures this year."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/10/22/looks-like-democrats-have-a-weed-fight-coming/,washingtonpost.com,Looks like Democrats have a weed fight coming,Jonathan Bernstein,10-22-2013,,"The news today from Gallup is that, for the first time in its polling, a majority indeed, a solid majority of Americans back legalizing marijuana . So far, most politicians have stuck with support for the status quo, or perhaps the status quo plus various exemptions and loopholes. With 58 percent of all respondents and 65 percent of Democrats favoring legalization, however, theres now a very good chance that a fair number of ambitious Democratic politicians are going to sign up for full legalization as a way to differentiate themselves in Democratic primaries. Matt Yglesias suggests that Hillary Clinton will be among them . I think thats perhaps premature, but maybe not. The way this probably will unfold is that a fair number of candidates will take a legalization position, and some may even try to run hard on it, in 2014 elections and especially Democratic primaries. If its perceived to be successful, then expect Clintons competitors for 2016 to flirt with or perhaps even embrace the position. Only after that or at least, only after its clear that it will happen would I expect Clinton to go along. As a strong front-runner (and assuming shes running), expect Clinton to avoid positions that she perceives as dangerous in a general election, but also expect her to match Democrats who embrace issues that could divide the party. All of that analysis, for Clinton and the rest, is based on an assumption that candidates will react here to electoral incentives rather than their personal views of the issue. I think thats extremely likely in this case; Id be very surprised if more than a handful of candidates for Congress next year have strong personal feelings on this. In that, its probably very different from marriage; while obviously electoral incentives were important, I suspect a lot of politicians cared quite a bit about it on substantive grounds. Its true that there are some libertarian candidates who may try to run on the issue in Republican primaries, but, for the most part, its still going to be a loser there. And remember: just because most Democratic voters support legalization in polls doesnt mean that its a voting issue for them. But, yes, I do think theres a good chance that its going to be an issue Democratic politicians jump on in 2014 and 2016."

Moyer,07-11-2017,,"Arrests for the public use of marijuana in the District nearly tripled in 2016 and are on track to remain high in 2017, public records show. More than 400 people were arrested in 2016 for public consumption of marijuana, according to D.C. police arrest records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. Records show 78 had been arrested as of April5. That compares with 142 people arrested in 2015, the year that marijuana use but not the sale of marijuana became legal in the city . Arrests for distribution of marijuana also nearly tripled last year from 80 in 2015 to 220 in 2016, according to the data. As of April5, 79 people had been arrested for distribution. The data include arrests by D.C. police and other law enforcement agencies in the city. Watch more! As of Feb. 26, 2015 marijuana was made legal in D.C.sort of. Here are the ins and outs of the complex pot law. In an email, D.C. police spokesman Dustin Sternbeck said the department had ""focused its drug enforcement efforts on illegal sales,"" leading to an increase in arrests for distribution. Legalization has led to more arrests for public consumption, Sternbeck said, even though smoking pot outside is still against the law. Some advocates criticized the increase in arrests, saying they disproportionately affected poor people and minorities. Jonathan Smith, executive director of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, an advocacy group that studied marijuana arrests before legalization, said the number of arrests was ""very troubling."" ""A rise in marijuana enforcement, especially at a time of historic and dropping levels of crime in the District, suggests a return to failed practices of overpolicing and underserving communities of color,"" Smith said. Adam Eidinger, the head of DCMJ, an advocacy group that lobbied for marijuana legalization in the District, was arrested twice in April after handing out free joints near the Capitol. He said the right to smoke marijuana in the District could only be enjoyed by ""those who own private property,"" whereas renters and those in public housing were left out. ""A lot of it is people not realizing they can't smoke in public,"" he said of the increase in arrests. ""A lot of it is people who have no place else to go."" Peter Hermann contributed to this report."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/wonk/wp/2016/10/12/police-arrest-more-people-for-marijuana-use-than-for-all-violent-crimes-combined/,washingtonpost.com,Police arrest more people for marijuana use than for all violent crimes combined,Christopher Ingraham,10-12-2016,,"On any given day in the United States, at least 137,000 peoplesit behind bars on simple drug-possession charges, according to a report released Wednesday by the American Civil Liberties Unionand Human Rights Watch. Nearly two-thirds of them are in local jails. The report says thatmost of these jailed inmates have not been convicted of any crime: They're sitting in a cell, awaiting a day in court, an appearance that may be months or even years off, because they can't afford to post bail. ""It's been 45 years since the war on drugs was declared, and it hasn't been a success,"" lead author Tess Borden of Human Rights Watch said in an interview.""Rates of drug use are not down. Drug dependency has not stopped. Every 25 seconds, we're arresting someone for drug use."" Federal figures on drug arrests and drug use over the past three decades tell the story. Drug-possession arrests skyrocketed, from fewer than 200 arrests for every 100,000 people in1979to more than500 in the mid-2000s. The drug-possession rate has since fallen slightly, according to the FBI, hovering near400 arrests per 100,000 people. Defenders of harsh penalties for drug possession say they are necessary to deter people from using drugs and to protect public health. But despitethe tough-on-crime push that led to the surge in arrests in recent decades , i llicit drug use today is more common among Americans age 12 and olderthan it was in the early 1980s. Federal figures show no correlation between drug-possession arrests and rates of drug useduring that time. But the ACLU and Human Rights Watch report shows thatarrests for drug possession continue to make up a significant chunk of modern-day police work. ""Around the country, police make more arrests for drug possession than for any other crime,"" the report finds, citing FBI data. ""More than one of every nine arrests by state law enforcement is for drug possession, amounting to more than 1.25 million arrests each year."" In fact, police make more arrests for marijuana possession alone than for all violent crimes combined. The report finds that the laws are enforced unequally, too. Over their lifetimes, black and white Americans use illicit drugs at similar rates, according to federal data. But black adults were more than 2 times as likely to be arrested for drug possession. ""We can't talk about race and policing in this country without talking about the No. 1 arrest offense,"" Borden said. The reportcalls for decriminializing the personal use and possession of drugs, treating it as a public-health matterinstead of a criminal one. ""Rather than promoting health, criminalization can create new barriers to health for thosewho use drugs,"" the report says. ""Criminalization drives drug use underground; it discourages access toemergency medicine, overdose prevention services, and risk-reducing practices such assyringe exchanges."" The report reinforces its point by noting the lengthy sentences handed down in some states for possession of small amounts of drugs. For example, itsketches the history of Corey J. Ladd, who was arrested for possessing half an ounce of marijuana during a 2011 traffic stop in New Orleans. Because he had convictions for two prior offenses involving the possession of small amounts of hydrocodone and LSD, he was sentenced in 2013 to 17 years in prison as a ""habitual offender."" He is currentlyappealing the sentence to Louisiana's Supreme Court. ""Corey's story is about the real waste of human lives, let alone taxpayer money, of arrest and incarceration for personal drug use,"" Borden said. ""He could be making money and providing for his family."" Watch more! How marijuana legalization in Washington, Colorado and Oregon is working out so far. But Ladd's treatment is far from the harshest drug-possession sentence uncovered by ACLU and Human Rights Watch researchers, whoconducted analyses of arrest and incarceration data from Florida, New York and Texas. In Texas, for instance, 116 people are currently serving life sentences on charges of simple drug possession. Seven of those people earned their sentences for possessing quantities of drugs weighing between 1 gram and 4 grams, or less than a typical sugar packet. That's because Texasalso has ahabitual-offender law, allowing prosecutors to seek longer-than-normal sentences for people who have two prior felonies. ""In 2015, more than 78 percent ofpeople sentenced to incarceration for felony drug possession in Texas possessed under agram,"" the report found."

More than 70 of them were growing in a hydroponic system of his own design. Sometimes, he'd stay in his barn for 16 hours straight, perfecting his technique. That night, he left around 8 o'clock to head home. The moon was waning, down to a sliver, which left the sky as dark as the ridges that lined it. As he pulled away, the lights from his late-model Kia swept across his childhood hollow and his parents' trailer, which stood just up the road from the barn. He turned onto West Virginia Route 65. Crossing Mingo County, he passed the Delbarton Mine, where he had worked on and off for 14 years before his back gave out. Though Johnsie was built like a linebacker, falling once from a coal truck and twice from end loaders had taken a toll. At 36, his disks were a mess, and sciatica sometimes shot pain to his knees. Still, he managed to lift the buckets that held his plants; friends sometimes helped. In another part of the barn, they had set up a man cave with a big-screen TV and girlie posters. When they weren't transplanting and trimming, they played video games and discussed their passion for cultivating pot. None of them had studied marijuana like Johnsie, but they all loved growing, seeing it not just as a hobby or a way to make a buck but as an act of compassion. ""Mostly the people that bought were older men and women, Vietnam veterans and people that's been hurt,"" Johnsie told me. ""I mean, to hear them say, 'You know, ever since I started smoking your pot, I ain't touched a pain pill ..."" He trailed off, shaking his head, but it was clear what he meant. In a state with one of the nation's highest rates of overdose deaths, most of them opioid-related, it felt good to give people an alternative, one that even the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said this year has never caused an overdose fatality. Minutes after leaving the barn, Johnsie parked in the light of his own trailer, a newly remodeled 14-by-60 that he shared with his wife, Faye, and 14-year-old daughter Bethany. His phone rang. It was a neighbor from Rutherford Branch Road, where the barn stood. Cops were there, asking about him. Inside, Johnsie dialed his mother. Two officers, she told him, were standing in her living room. She handed the phone to one of them. Though he didn't have a search warrant for the barn, the officer said he could get one, according to Johnsie. ""But,"" he said, ""I think it would be better if you come and talk to me first."" (This account is based largely on Johnsie's recollection. Neither arresting officer was permitted to be interviewed for this story, but it is consistent with a description of Johnsie's case in the 2015 West Virginia State Police Annual Report.) Johnsie hung up. He'd placed cameras around his building and vented it out the back, but people were packed tight into that narrow hollow. It was only a matter of time before someone figured out what was inside. Turning to his wife, he said, ""Look, I'm going up there, and I'm going to jail."" With Skoal tobacco, his one chemical vice, pressed tightly against his cheek, Johnsie drove back to Rutherford Branch Road, where officers met him outside. ""It's like this. I got your dad. I got a lot of pot on him,"" Senior Trooper D.L. Contos told him. This was no surprise. Sam Gooslin had smoked pot for decades, and half of Johnsie's pot went to him. His dad relied on it to ease pain from lung cancer, a new ailment layered atop others diabetes, a stroke, four heart attacks and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. ""He's a Vietnam veteran,"" Johnsie recalls Contos saying. ""I respect that. I don't want to see a veteran go to jail. If you make me go get a search warrant, I'm taking you to jail, and I'm gonna get your dad on felony conspiracy charges because he's taking the blame on what's going on up there."" Johnsie had only one option. He crossed the road and unlocked the barn, opening a series of doors to release a flood of light. The officers paused. One said he had busted hundreds of marijuana operations and had never seen anything like this. For the next two hours, Johnsie walked the officers through his process. He explained the role of the lights and hydroponics; why he placed three plants in a bucket, not one; how he used gibberellic acid to push the plants at just the right time. At the end, he recalls Contos telling him they had to seize his plants, but, referring to Johnsie's equipment and supplies, he said, ""I'm not going to take it away. One day, this might be legal."" The first time Johnsie planted pot, he was 14. He stole a single seed from his father and buried it. ""I didn't know what I was doing,"" he recalls. ""I was just a kid being a kid."" That seed barely grew, but it did take root in a sense. Years later, while still working in the mines, he began reading about marijuana cultivation. Though he'd already learned that he couldn't smoke it himself (every attempt made his heart race and left him paranoid), the science behind the plant, the act of nurturing it, enthralled him. After he stopped working at the mine about five years ago, and after his father gave him the barn, Johnsie tried growing marijuana again, this time treating the exercise more as a science experiment. He was actually the third generation of Gooslins with a passion for pot. His father didn't grow it but smoked it constantly. His grandfather, a former Kentucky constable, was just the opposite. He never used marijuana but sold it to supplement his retirement income. At one time this sort of thing wasn't uncommon, says 1st Sgt. Michael Smith, who heads West Virginia's drug-eradication efforts: ""It was generally local individuals that would go back in the woods and, similar to the image of old-time moonshiners, they would get them a clandestine location and take care of their crops. Families would grow marijuana. ... They would hand it down."" Reliable estimates of the size of the marijuana market in West Virginia are hard to come by. According to the group NORML, which advocates for marijuana legalization, pot has been West Virginia's most valuable cash crop for the past 20 years. Lately, however, marijuana has been overshadowed by opioids, which are devastating parts of coal country. In Mingo County, where Johnsie lives, a single pharmacy pumped out 9 million hydrocodone pills over just two years, according to a 2016 investigation by the Charleston Gazette-Mail. That was enough for every man, woman and child in the area to have 350 of them. Hydrocodone was part of a new generation of opioids that pharmaceutical companies introduced in the United States in the past two decades and heavily marketed to doctors as posing minimal risk for addiction. That, of course, wasn't true, and as government officials cracked down on prescription opioids, they became prohibitively expensive, pushing addicts in West Virginia and elsewhere toward illegal substitutes, including heroin, which ran about a third the price. The Mountain State is now ground zero of one of the worst drug crises in our nation's history. In 2015, 725 people died of overdoses in the state, the highest rate per capita in the country. Last year, that figure grew another 15 percent, reaching a staggering 844 deaths. That averages to one West Virginian dying from an overdose every 11 hours. Eighty-six percent of the state's overdose deaths in 2016 involved an opioid. While there are no easy answers to the opioid crisis, a growing body of research suggests that legalizing marijuana could help. More than a dozen states with legal medical marijuana have recorded significant drops in overdose deaths from other drugs, including heroin, according to a 2014 study in JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association. A 2015 pilot study by Yasmin Hurd at the Behavioral Health System's Addiction Institute at Mount Sinai found that cannabidiol, a compound in marijuana, minimized cravings for opioids, making it easier for participants to stop using them. And unlike methadone, an opioid that is used in drug treatment to minimize cravings for opioids, cannabidiol was not addictive. Hurd is pursuing further research but argues that legislators must address this epidemic now. ""You can't wait for all the ducks to be lined up,"" she says. ""You sometimes have to make bold steps."" Attempts to decriminalize marijuana in West Virginia date to at least 2010, but for years no bills made it out of committee. As of 2015, the year of Johnsie's arrest, stalwarts in the Republican-dominated legislature still could not bring themselves to legalize marijuana for medical use. But younger lawmakers would not let the issue go. One of the leading proponents of loosening restrictions on marijuana in West Virginia is Democratic state Del. Mike Pushkin, who represents parts of Charleston and its surrounding areas. Pushkin is an unconventional pol a cabdriver and folk musician who has spoken about his own struggles with addiction. He once told the Charleston Gazette-Mail how he spent 11 years living from crisis to crisis. ""I'm sure there were times that my mother would have thought it more likely she would be attending my funeral than she would be attending my swearing-in at the Capitol,"" he said. It took a spiritual awakening to get his addiction under control. To stay sober, he told me, he volunteers at detox facilities and talks to addicts in area jails. This experience informs his policy positions. He's sure West Virginia can't arrest its way out of this drug crisis. And he has pushed his colleagues to consider marijuana in a new light. ""While marijuana is described as a gateway drug, that's not proven,"" he says. ""What is proven is that a lot of people who are prescribed painkillers get hooked on heroin."" Though he spent only 14 hours in jail, Johnsie returned to his trailer a different man . The police did not confiscate his equipment, but he was still charged with a felony for cultivating marijuana. That, combined with his back problems, made it nearly impossible to find work. He was not allowed to leave the state, which meant he could not move to a place where he could grow marijuana legally. With his $1,000 or so in monthly pot sales gone and Faye making just $9 an hour as a cashier at a gas station, cash was dwindling fast. They had begun receiving $129 in food stamps, but that didn't help much. ""Three people eats more than that in a week,"" Faye says. Johnsie's lawyer, Wesley Kent Varney, chose for strategic reasons not to rush his case, instead engaging in a slow, courteous dialogue with Mingo County Prosecuting Attorney Teresa Maynard. He thought he could get Johnsie off on a technicality, in part because the pot the police confiscated later disappeared. Varney told me police also found no marijuana ""bricked up"" for shipping, no scales, not even any large sums of money making this a low-priority case for Maynard. Even when she proposed a plea bargain that would have put Johnsie under home arrest, Varney sat on the option, hoping to get a better deal. (Maynard declined to comment for this story.) That approach kept Johnsie free, but his family's losses started adding up. Debt collectors began calling. Both their cars were repossessed. ""Before I was arrested,"" he says, ""we was both pushing an 800 credit score. Wasn't nothing we couldn't buy on credit at any given time. Now, I think mine is 500 and hers is like 470. Pitiful."" About a year after his arrest, the bank came for their trailer the nicest place Johnsie had ever lived, and just about the only home his teen daughter could remember. The family got 24 hours' notice. Their sole option was moving to the battered trailer next door that had passed hands in Faye's family over and over until it was empty and rusting with bent underpinnings and insulation peeking through holes in the walls. It was raining that day, and no one could help. That left Johnsie, with his bad back, and Faye to carry their belongings through the mud. They hauled all they could but ended up leaving a lot. ""We worked ourselves to death,"" Faye recalls, ""and we just couldn't do it."" She didn't go outside when the repo guys came. Instead, she watched through a leaky aluminum-framed window as they hitched up their trailer and hauled it off. Her living-room furniture, desk and bed frame were still inside. After that, Johnsie rarely left home. During the days, while his daughter was at school and Faye at work, he alternated between his computer chair, where he read articles about marijuana reform elsewhere (Massachusetts, Maine, California and Nevada would all legalize adult use of the drug in 2016), and the window. There, he'd chew tobacco and stare at bare soil, where their old home had rested. In May 2016, Pushkin introduced a bill in the West Virginia House of Delegates to let adults grow, use and possess a limited quantity of marijuana, provided that they paid a one-time fee of $500. That month, he told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that he didn't have high hopes for its passage. He was right: It wasn't even debated in a committee. But it did spark media attention and prompted an eye-opening brief from the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, which showed that a marijuana tax could be a boon for the state, generating as much as $194 million annually if the drug were legal for adult use. That would be enough to eliminate West Virginia's projected deficit and create a $183million surplus, a dramatic improvement in a place that's been slashing everything from higher education to Medicaid as it tries to stay afloat. Indeed, Pushkin's argument for marijuana legalization had a strong economic component. ""They're not having the types of budget issues in Colorado that we're having here,"" he told the Charleston Gazette-Mail. In Colorado, where pot is now fully legalized, the industry created 18,000 full-time jobs in 2015 alone. New Frontier Data, a financial consultancy in Washington, estimates that by 2020 the marijuana industry will create upward of a quarter of a million jobs in the United States, more than manufacturing is expected to create. It's hard to imagine anywhere that could use these jobs more than West Virginia. Since the 1980s, both coal and manufacturing in the Mountain State have been in a steep decline. As these industries have dried up, so have others that rely on them such as freight rail, which has cut jobs by the thousands and begun pulling up tracks. Smart leaders would have diversified their economy decades ago, but that didn't happen here. ""We've been relying on the extraction industries for far too long,"" Pushkin told me, noting that West Virginia is not just experiencing a budget crisis or even a drug crisis. The state's population is shrinking; many who stay are depressed by their prospects and taking poor care of themselves. A National Bureau of Economic Research paper published in February found a positive correlation between a county's unemployment rate and its opioid overdose death rate. And a link between unemployment and drug use was also confirmed by a meta-analysis of 28 studies, including 10 done in the United States, that appeared in the June issue of the International Journal of Drug Policy . Diabetes rates exceed 150 percent of the U.S. average in some parts of West Virginia, and obesity is just as severe. Pushkin sees the opioid crisis as more of a symptom of the underlying economic one. ""When you see countries that are based on one industry, those are mainly Third World countries,"" he says. ""We're really like a Third World country inside the United States."" In his rundown trailer, with no end to his legal limbo in sight, Johnsie soon faced another setback. His father had begun having seizures. They became so routine that Johnsie was not alarmed when, on June 24, 2016, he got a call informing him that Sam Gooslin was bound for the hospital. But this time, when Johnsie arrived and said his name at the nurse's station, a chaplain approached. ""I knew then it wasn't good,"" he recalls. No one was sure, but they thought his father might have had another stroke. This one was just too big. As the two-year anniversary of his arrest approached, Johnsie found himself without his father, unable to pursue his passion and flat broke. He grew more reclusive and stopped having people over because he was ashamed of where he lived. ""Gained 20 pounds,"" he says. ""Just sitting and waiting on death."" But just as he began to feel like he was fighting a losing battle, Maynard, who had lost her reelection bid, decided to step down early. The incoming county prosecuting attorney, Jonathan Jewell, was inheriting a mound of cases. Varney was quick to point out a case that the new prosecutor could settle fast one where the defendant, Johnsie, had kept his nose clean for two years while on bond. This was a gift to Jewell, who scheduled a hearing for Jan. 31. (Jewell did not respond to requests for comment.) For several nights prior, Johnsie lay awake, thinking about all that had happened. Beside his sleeping wife, with his daughter just a thin, splintered wall away, he tried to picture their future. He couldn't work coal, not with his back like it was, or even stand at a register all day. That and growing marijuana was about all he was qualified to do. He could probably get a job at a legal growhouse in California. He knew somebody who knew somebody who owned one. But Johnsie was a good-old-boy conservative. He supported Trump and pokes fun at liberals. He loves guns and four-wheeling. ""I just don't know if I can handle California,"" he once told me. Plus, how could he uproot Bethany while she was doing so well in school taking advanced placement classes? He wouldn't dare do anything to upset her future. The morning of his hearing, Johnsie rose bleary-eyed and, with Faye, drove under a bright winter sky. The 20-minute ride was quiet. They didn't know what to expect at the Mingo County Courthouse. Inside, things moved fast. Each lawyer said a few words, and within 10 minutes, West Virginia Circuit Court Judge Miki J. Thompson dismissed the case without prejudice. For the first time in two years, Johnsie was truly free. He and Faye drove back to their side of the county and, at the gas station where she worked, celebrated with ice cream cones. Meanwhile in Charleston, Pushkin and like-minded lawmakers saw an opening to try again for legalization. In late 2016, both gubernatorial candidates had publicly supported legalizing medical marijuana. And some of their colleagues were showing a new openness to it. In February, he backed legislation focusing on medical marijuana. While it met with familiar opposition in the House of Delegates, a similar bill wove through the state Senate with bipartisan support. This forced the House speaker and other old-guard Republicans to soften their stance. The bill not only made it out of committee, it was debated on the House floor and an amended version passed. The bill permits patients to use pot derivatives, such as oils and pills, but prohibits smoking the plant or growing it at home. Just 10 growers will be authorized statewide, and the price to play will be steep a $50,000 registration fee. On April 19, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice (D) signed it into law. Many lawmakers who voted for the bill were reacting to public pressure and media scrutiny. And although the law passed, there is no certainty that the trend toward loosening restrictions on marijuana will continue. ""Close to half the people who voted for that [legislation] are against medical cannabis,"" Pushkin told me, ""but we got something on the books. I do believe we can fix it."" A bill he introduced to tax medical marijuana is in committee. Beyond that, Pushkin admits, he is still figuring out what to do next. Johnsie doesn't like coffee. Rather than order anything at the coffee shop where he and I are meeting Pushkin on a Friday in May, he waits at an empty table, nervous and fidgeting. I get hot tea, and we talk about how unlikely this sit-down is. With his background, Johnsie never imagined he'd talk to a man who could help undo laws that ruined his life. But when I told Pushkin about Johnsie weeks before and asked if they could meet, the delegate said yes. Coming off an 11-hour shift of cab driving, one that took him clear to Ohio and back, Pushkin walks in while wiping rainwater from his shirt. Both men wear jeans. Pushkin's jeans have a hole over the left pocket. Johnsie's are paired with a button-down for the occasion. Though neither looks their part a West Virginia delegate and a former pot grower they somehow appear to belong at the same table. With a handshake and a nod, they begin a slow discourse on the new marijuana law. Johnsie may have found a financial backer, a Michigan businessman who visits Mingo County's ATV trail a few times a year, but breaking into legal marijuana production would be much easier if the fee were lower. He references a provision that's popular in other states, one that assigns ""caregivers"" to patients. These licensed professionals help people get and use their marijuana. They can even grow it for them. By his own admission, Pushkin doesn't know a lot about the provision, but he's always looking for new ideas. ""I wouldn't mind going back and trying to get that in,"" he later tells me, showing the kind of openness that defines his vision for West Virginia. Pushkin still sees tremendous potential in his home state. Charleston, for instance, has the kind of ""cultural capital"" that attracts newer industries prewar buildings galore, gritty warehouses begging to become lofts, and indie businesses that include a sprawling bookstore-cafe-gallery and a new art-house cinema. In many ways, it resembles Pittsburgh or Asheville, N.C., before those cities became hipster meccas, and Pushkin looks to those places as models. Legalizing recreational use of marijuana could be another asset, a way to boost tourism and retain young people. ""I want to fight to make it the kind of state friends want to move back to,"" he later says. ""I want to help make this a cool place again."" The scruffy delegate pauses to sip his coffee, and Johnsie fiddles with his phone. Quiet passes between them until Johnsie begins to talk about his passion for marijuana. ""I'd fall asleep at night studying,"" he says, ""with the laptop still on."" He describes the intricacies of growing, his hydroponic technique, how he kept his plants budding. Pushkin looks down. When he first learned about Johnsie, he said, ""I'm sorry that this prohibition has turned somebody who was just trying to help their father into a criminal."" Sitting across from this man who lost everything, who had been stripped of his home and livelihood, who is no longer permitted to pursue his passion, Pushkin grips his mug. ""This is the kind of story that needs to be told in the statehouse,"" he says and shakes his head. The two talk a few minutes more until Pushkin's coffee is gone. He stands up and though many politicians wouldn't have even entertained a conversation with a former marijuana grower he extends his hand. ""I'm going to give you my number,"" he says, looking Johnsie in the eye. ""Call anytime you need help."" After they part, Johnsie and I go for pizza; then he drives an hour in the rain, back to Mingo County, where he and Faye have been keeping their expenses low. She has saved just enough to buy a used car. He now drives a 17-year-old truck inherited from an uncle and spends his days making low-cost improvements to his trailer. While hanging drywall one day to cover torn wallpaper and exposed wires, he deliberates on his future. He still hates the idea of moving to another state. West Virginia gets ahold of you, he once told me, and won't let go. Maybe he can get one of those 10 marijuana-farm licenses. Maybe the legislature will make it easier for regular people to take part in this new industry. He's not sure how exactly, but he's determined to grow his ""babies"" again. He beams at the thought. ""Hook the water and electricity up, and I'd have seeds in the cups tonight,"" he muses and spits chewing tobacco into an empty bottle. ""I'm ready to go anytime, when the law says you can do it."""

The Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) lobbies to eliminate punishments for marijuana use but is not involved in growing or distributing the drug an important distinction for federally regulated banks and other institutions that do business with such advocacy groups. Nick Field, the MPP's chief operating officer, said a PNC Bank representative told him in May that the organization's accounts would be permanently closed July7 because an audit of the accounts revealed that the organization received funding from marijuana businesses that handle the plant directly. ""They told me it is too risky. The bank can't assume the risk,"" Field said. Although marijuana businesses are legal in some states, many banks will not provide services to sellers or growers because the drug is banned at the federal level. But policy and advocacy organizations such as the MPP have been spared. A bank's severing ties with an organization that accepts donations from such businesses signals a new level of concern in the banking industry. PNC Bank declined to discuss its relationship with the MPP, but a spokeswoman said that ""as a federally regulated financial institution, PNC complies with all applicable federal laws and regulations."" The bank has held the MPP's accounts since the organization was formed in 1995. Some advocacy groups say the abrupt closing of the MPP's accounts is an unpleasant side effect of growing uncertainty about protections for the marijuana industry in states that have legalized it. The industry enjoys loose protection via a combination of legislative amendments and memos from the Justice Department that effectively allow states to operate medical and recreational marijuana businesses without federal interference. But many advocates worry that the Trump administration is changing course to enforce federal laws and dismantle key protections for the expanding industry. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is a longtime opponent of marijuana legalization. During a Senate drug hearing in April 2016, Sessions then a Republican senator from Alabama said, ""We need grown-ups in charge in Washington to say marijuana is not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized, it ought not to be minimized, that it's in fact a very real danger."" When asked during his confirmation hearing in January whether he would enforce federal drug laws as attorney general, Sessions replied, ""I won't commit to never enforcing federal law."" The Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment. Last week , Sessions wrote to congressional leaders asking for the ability to prosecute medical-marijuana dispensaries. Sessions implored members of Congress to reconsider a rule enacted in 2014 to prevent the Justice Department from using federal funds to block state laws that legalize medical-marijuana cultivation and use. The sale of recreational marijuana, in contrast, is loosely protected by the 2013 ""Cole memo."" The memo, issued by Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole during the Obama administration, instructs state law enforcement agencies not to use their resources to prosecute the authorized sale of marijuana in states where it is legal. The vice president for regulatory compliance at the American Bankers Association says these protections are not enough reassurance for financial institutions. Banks are subject to federal regulation to prevent fraud, money laundering or breaches of privacy. ""Because marijuana is illegal under federal law, banks accepting any money associated with its sale could be investigated for money laundering,"" said Rob Rowe, the ABA executive, adding that many banks do not make a distinction between advocacy organizations and businesses that sell or grow marijuana. But Field's organization, the MPP, and many other advocacy groups, such as NORML, say banks' concerns are overblown. The Justice Department has never investigated a bank for offering accounts to state-legal marijuana businesses. In addition, Field said, advocacy organizations are legal entities that are subject to strict scrutiny by the IRS. ""We are a registered 501(c)(3) and (c)(4). We have yearly audits. We are compliant with the IRS,"" he said. ""It doesn't get any clearer than that."" Field said the MPP is still seeking a new bank. John Hudak, an expert on marijuana policy and governance at the Brookings Institution, suspects that the MPP's difficulty in finding another bank reflects banks' fears that Sessions intends to roll back protections for the industry and enforce the federal Controlled Substances Act. ""It's no secret,"" Hudak said. ""It's a situation that is creating an increasingly uncertain policy environment."" Amid the uncertainty, Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) introduced a bill to ensure protections for banks providing ""financial services to cannabis-related legitimate businesses."" The Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act, introduced in April, has 44 congressional co-sponsors. The first provision of the bill would prevent federal regulators from terminating banks' federal deposit and share insurance ""solely because the depository institution provides or has provided financial services to a cannabis-related legitimate business."" Many marijuana advocacy organizations hope the bill will pass, offering the industry the banking security it seeks. ""It's one thing to take a position about making marijuana legal,"" said Mason Tvert, the MPP's communications director. ""It's something different to say these businesses should be able to be bank legitimately."" Marijuana advocacy groups point to public opinion as an indication of the industry's legitimacy. Last year, 60percent of Americans surveyed by Gallup thought marijuana should be legal. Justin Strekal, policy director at D.C.-based NORML, said the attorney general is fighting a losing battle against legalization. Strekal is optimistic that organizations such as the MPP, as well as marijuana businesses, will not face the setbacks they have dealt with in past. But he cautioned that things could become worse before they improve. ""This is the death rattle of prohibition,"" Strekal said. ""While we are confident in the end that we will win, it does not mean that [Sessions] isn't going to do as much damage as he can to the industry between now and when he is no longer in power."""

We need mass pardons.",David Moscrop,07-18-2018,,"An employee pulls out a tray of drying cannabis buds at a harvest facility in Pelham, Ontario. The legal recreational use of marijuana in Canada is set to start Oct. 17. (Cole Burston/Bloomberg News) David Moscrop is a Canadian political commentator. The march of moral progress is slow. Typically,it is routinely punctuated by halts and detours and backward treks. So, when the Canadian government legalized cannabis last month setting Oct. 17 as the day the Victorian criminalization of the recreational use of the substance will end it was no surprise that it failed to address the matter of what to do with those who possess criminal records for minor possession convictions. Instead, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale have said they will consider pardons, known in Canada as record suspensions, after the law comes into effect. They are essentially asking those struggling with criminal records to stew in their own anxiety and stigma a little longer, preserving the issue for the Liberal Party as a horse it can ride toward the fall 2019 election. Forgiveness should have been part of the legislative package from Day One. But since it is impossible to go back in time to correct this wrong, the best the government can do is promise pardons immediately and move on to getting the thing done. Not everyone agrees. If you are the sort who is prone to reaching for the life preserver when the water gets choppy, you might be inclined to cry, But what of law and order? Those convicted broke the law. Nevermind that as a personal and public health risk, alcohol, prescription drugs and cheeseburgers are causing far greater damage. The paternalist prohibition on the use of cannabis has always reflected a state more concerned with empty moralizing (Wont someone please think of the children?) led by timorous politicians who opted to tread a well-worn path rather than cut a new and righteous one of their own. As a result, Canadians have had their lives destroyed because they happened to be unlucky enough to be caught by an officer who felt like enforcing the law that day. Not only was the law foolish; it was inconsistently applied, which means it was also unjust. Arrests, charges and convictions for minor cannabis possession have been appliedarbitrarily and leniently to white and wealthy Canadians. The same cannot be said for poor and black and indigenous peoples, who have been disproportionately affected by prohibitionist drug laws and who still carry with them the criminal records and difficulty finding work to prove it. In an investigative report this spring, Vice News and University of Toronto criminologists Akwasi Owusu-Bempah and Alex Luscombe studied six Canadian cities (Regina, Halifax, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver and Ottawa) and found that the application of the law was vigorously prejudiced. For instance, in Ottawa, the nations sleepy capital, black residents made up 22 percent of the citys cannabis arrests in 2015 despite representing 6 percent of its population. In Vancouver, a pot-friendly town, indigenous Vancouverites accounted for 17 percent of charges despite being just 2.5 percent of the population. The numbers are similar across the country. Mass pardons for small-time cannabis convictions would be the first and easiest step toward correcting some of the injustices rooted in Canadas historically regressive drug policies. They would clear the names of offenders, thereby helping them find their way back into the workforce, easing their travel across borders, and sparing them the cost of the process (more than $600 in Canadian currency about $455 in U.S. money just to apply for grace) and the long wait to begin it (five years after the sentence is complete). The way that legalization is proceeding is Kafkaesque. As the cannabis market opens wide in Canada, among the first through the gate to stake their claim and chase their fortune have been former politicians, lawyers, officers of the law and others in positions of authority. That is especially perverse considering that so many are stuck waiting for pardons and left out of the market. The just and decent and practical thing for Canada to do is to get on with pardons for those convicted of minor cannabis possession. Spare the moralizing. Spare the hand-wringing. Spare the suburban community pandering. Spare the temporizing that conveniently leads up to and perhaps into the next election. Get the job done, and get it done now so that those who have unjustly borne the unreasonable burden of these convictions and criminal records can move on with their lives while the country does the same."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/powerpost/wp/2017/11/06/veterans-tell-of-medical-marijuana-use-in-defiance-of-backward-federal-policy/,washingtonpost.com,Veterans tell of medical marijuana use in defiance of backward federal policy,Joe Davidson,11-06-2017,,"If it wasnt for medical marijuana, I wouldnt be here today, says Joshus Frey, a combat Marine with two Purple Hearts. Frey is pictured speaking at an American Legion news conference in Washington on Thursday. Photo by Lucas Carter/The American Legion Joshua James Frey is clear: Without medical marijuana I would be dead. This Marine Corps veteran is a two-time Purple Heart awardee. He is among the former warfighters, led by the American Legion, who are on the frontlines of the fight for a sensible, federal medical marijuana policy. They are pushing a reluctant Uncle Sam to catch up with overwhelming public opinion that favors allowing cannabis for medical use. We covered the Legions Capitol Hill press conference on Thursday with Frey, other veterans and a bipartisan group from Congress. Veterans, among the most respected citizens, are a potent force in the effort to move the federal government from a backward, anti-marijuana stance that resembles the 1936 melodramatic film propaganda of Reefer Madness more than todays reality of widespread medical cannabis use. Now, we hear the stories of two veterans who use medical marijuana and one who didnt, but whose mother believes would be alive if he did. In powerful, emotional statements at the news conference, they all complained about the dangers of the drug cocktails prescribed by doctors who are prohibited from even discussing the marijuana that has proven far more beneficial for the two vets. Their stories differ starkly from a presidential commission on drug addiction report this month that said there is a lack of sophisticated outcome data on dose, potency, and abuse potential for marijuana. Lets start with Frey, a Melbourne, Fla., combat veteran of the Third Battalion, First Marine Regiment. Medical marijuana saved me, he told the Federal Insider. I feel like I did before the war (in Iraq) mentally and know this could help not just the veterans struggling, but it could help anyone struggling with addiction and PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder). Its time we all stand as one voice and truly move forward withreal hard-lined research and move forward with real compassionate care. Frey was wounded twice in 2004, once in November by a rocket-propelled grenade . Less than a month later, shortly before Christmas, he was shot in the right shoulder, shattering it and detaching his right bicep. He spent two years at the Naval Medical Center San Diego, also known as Balboa Hospital, had six blood transfusions and 22 operations. Ive been real quiet about my medical marijuana use, he said at the news conference. If it wasnt for medical marijuana, I wouldnt be here today. I wouldnt have kids today. I wouldnt have a beautiful wife Ive been married to for 13 years now. He resents the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) saying you are doing something bad. We need to stop the madness. We need to get this stuff on the books. It could help a lot of vets. Boone Cutler is an Army veteran who spent two years in Walter Reed Army Medical Center recovering from combat injuries suffered in Baghdad. Host of the Tipping Point show on KNEWS, 107.3 FM in Reno, Nev., he has been diagnosed with early-onset Parkinsons disease, related to his wartime blast injury. He authored the Spartan Pledge, the veterans commitment against suicide, and is a national spokesman for the Warfighter Rights Movement on PTSD issues. Boone Cutler, a medically retired Army veteran, describes the moment he contemplated suicide, blaming the prescription drugs for losing my self-preservation instinct. Photo by Lucas Carter/The American Legion During his two years at Walter Reed, I was given just about every chemical cocktail you can imagine. When people look at that cocktail they want to know two things. One, why am I still alive and two, why isnt somebody in prison, because it was that dangerous. At a low point, he grabbed my gun and put it to my head, blaming the prescription drugs for losing my self-preservation instinct. He turned to marijuana to help him sleep. My story is not one of Cheech and Chong, he said, sunglasses perched just above his eyes. It wasnt a good time when I started using cannabis. It was simply a way to survive. When he tried marijuana he slept for five hours. At that time, he said, I hadnt slept for five hours in five years. Janos Johnny Lutz isnt here to tell his story, so his mother did. She told a sad tale of depression and prescription drug complicit suicide. He saw combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, where 14 of his colleagues died during Operation Khanjar in Helmand Province in 2009. It is our hope that the story of my son, who was lost because of prescribed pharmaceuticals will open your hearts and minds to research, Janine Lutz said before an emotional pause, to research cannabis, the most safe and effective treatment for our veterans today. She started the LCpl Janos V Lutz Live to Tell Foundation in Davie, Fla., in support of military and first responders. Janine Lutz, CEO of the LCpl Janos V Lutz Live to Tell Foundation, talks about the suicide of her son, who overdosed on drugs that doctors prescribed. Photo by Lucas Carter/The American Legion Her son was diagnosed with severe PTSD and brain injury. The two dozen drugs he was prescribed included Klonopin, which he took in June 2010. Within a week, Johnny attempted suicide, said Lutz. Her son was saved, and Do not give Mr. Lutz Klonopin was noted on his hospital chart. But the veteran was not told that, and he continued to believe that he wanted to take his own life by his own free will, his mother said, not knowing that it was the medication that was messing with his mind. Three months later he was given the drug again, only to be followed by another unsuccessful suicide attempt. This scenario repeated in 2013, but this time her son was successful in his suicide by overdosing on the drugs doctors prescribed. I think my son would be here today, Lutz said, if medical marijuana had been available. But its not for veterans at VA facilities. Almost two-thirds of the general population , however, live in the 29 states and the District where doctors can recommend it. At the VA, medical professionals are not allowed to even discuss marijuana therapy. Many veterans, some using medical cannabis from other sources, have asked VA doctors such as Katherine Mitchell in Phoenix about it. I was not officially allowed to discuss the subject, she said. Whether the establishment wants to recognize it or not, Mitchell added, because marijuana use has moved into the mainstream,health-care providers have an ethical obligation to help our patients understand the potential positive and negative impacts marijuana could have on their health. Instead, she and other VA medical professionals must act like medical marijuana doesnt exist. What sense does that make?"

Blood,09-11-2018,,"Nearly 20 percent of the marijuana and marijuana products tested in California for potency and purity have failed, according to state data provided to The Associated Press. (Chris Carlson/Associated Press) LOS ANGELES Nearly 20 percent of marijuana products in California have failed tests for potency and purity since the state started requiring the checks on July 1, a failure rate some in the industry say has more to do with unrealistic standards and technical glitches than protecting consumer safety. The testing has been especially tough on cannabis-infused cookies, candies and tinctures: About one-third have been blocked from store shelves. In much smaller numbers, testing companies licensed by the state are finding unacceptable levels of pesticides, solvents and bacteria, including E. coli and salmonella, according to data provided to The Associated Press by the state Bureau of Cannabis Control. In the first two months, nearly 11,000 samples were tested and almost 2,000 failed. In some cases, the product must be destroyed. But many involve labeling issues that can be corrected. For example, a marijuana bud thats tested to show a different potency than whats on the label can be relabeled and sold with the right specification. To the state, the strict testing program is largely doing what it was designed to do: identify marijuana buds, concentrates, munchies and other products that are in some way tainted and unsuitable for eating or smoking. Mandatory statewide testing is a new thing and its going to take some time for everything to run smoothly, but on the whole were pleased with how things are progressing, Bureau of Cannabis Control spokesman Alex Traverso said. But as regulators consider recasting rules governing the nations largest legal pot economy, they are facing pressure to revamp testing requirements that are being alternately described as going too far, not far enough, or an overly costly burden. The California Growers Association, an industry group, is among those concerned the state is forcing growers and manufacturers to hit too tiny a target when gauging levels of THC, the psychoactive chemical that causes marijuanas high. Rules require the THC concentration come within 10 percent of what is advertised on a product label. Company executives say some products are being rejected after landing outside the margin by tiny amounts. The California Cannabis Manufacturers Association, another industry group, is pushing for changes that include allowing companies to challenge lab testing results. Even if the lab admits it made an error, there is no way to change those results, said Bryce Berryessa, an association board member who is CEO of TreeHouse dispensary in Santa Cruz County and president of La Vida Verde, which produces infused cookies. Labs are not perfect. Mistakes get made, he said. At a state hearing last month, the Santa Ana-based testing company Cannalysis urged regulators to broaden their rules to include a test used in food and pharmaceutical industries that company officials say can detect a large number of potentially harmful species of mold and yeast not currently covered in state guidelines. The company has seen examples where mold was on cannabis but the sample passed state tests. Swetha Kaul, the companys chief scientific officer who sits on the board of the California Cannabis Industry Association, said in an interview the state needs to create a bigger net to catch things. By limiting its required review to a few mold species the state is essentially creating a loophole where every other species can get by, she said. California began broad legal sales on Jan. 1 and gave companies six months to sell off stockpiles of marijuana, oils and edibles produced without strict testing requirements. The rules require all cannabis products to clear a range of tests at labs before reaching consumers, from ensuring THC is distributed evenly in chocolate bars to making sure buds have not been contaminated by fuzzy blankets of mold. From July 1 through Aug. 29, labs tested 10,695 product batches and 1,904 were rejected, a failure rate of about 18 percent. Claims on the label, such as THC content, accounted for 65 percent of the failures, or 1,279 tests. This is how the rule works: If a bottled juice drink said on the label it was 25 percent apple juice, testers would have to find that the concentration in the juice was within 10 percent of that mark, plus or minus. Its the same with cannabis. Next in line: About 400 batches were flagged for unacceptable levels of pesticides. Impurities such as bacteria and mold caused 114 rejections. Ninety percent of the buds that were tested were sent on to shops, suggesting a mostly clean market for legal growers. The rejection rate was double that for concentrates: 20 percent of oils and waxes tested didnt make the cut. In a statement, the California Department of Public Health said it had not received any verified reports of illness resulting from consumption of a cannabis product attributed to mold or bacteria, although three complaints were submitted anonymously and were unverifiable. The debate over testing isnt just about lab procedures or allowable levels of pesticides. It all comes with a cost, which companies say is straining their budgets. Testing is currently costly, slow, and inconsistent, the growers association told the state in a recent letter. Testing for a small, outdoor marijuana farm can typically run $5,000 to $10,000 in California. There have been similar complaints in pot-friendly Colorado, where cultivators are dealing with new, required pesticide tests. While California now has the nations largest legal market, a huge black market still exists. Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore spotlighted the risk of buying on the illegal market last week, warning consumers that the price from money saved can be their life. He said unlicensed shops are known to lace their pot with Fentanyl and other narcotics. In an illegal shop theres no telling what theyre actually buying, Moore said."

(David Zalubowski/AP) Four decades after Virginia legalized medical marijuana in a pioneering but ultimately unworkable way, dozens of companies are vying for the states permission to grow cannabis and make a medicinal oil out of the otherwise outlawed weed. Under emergency legislation passed early this year, Virginia will grant up to five permits to produce cannabidiol (CBD) oil or THC-A oil. Stripped of most of the plants THC, the chemical compound that triggers the intoxicating reaction in the nervous system, the oils have been touted as treatments for severe seizures and other maladies. Virginia is taking a restrictive approach as it once again cracks open the door to medical marijuana, giving the green light only to the low-THC oils and prohibiting the smokable, high-inducing variety available to anyone with a doctors note in neighboring Maryland and to any adult, in small amounts, in the District. In fact, Virginia has not even formally legalized the oils, providing only an affirmative defense to anyone charged with possession. For that reason, NORML, the nations leading advocate for marijuana legalization, does not include Virginia in its count of 31 states that have legalized medicinal use. Then-Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe holds Haley Smith on his lap in 2015 after signing bills that allow the possession of marijuana oils to help treat patients with epilepsy. (Bob Brown/AP) Virginia is following its own course in creeping into the medical cannabis space, said Jeremy Unruh, director of public and regulatory affairs for PharmaCann, one of 32 companies competing for five permits. Each state has the right and authority to craft a program thats sensitive to the needs and sensibilities of its own local citizens. The companies that ultimately get in on the commonwealths marijuana-oil market will operate within a regulatory framework that sharply limits the number of producers and dictates how they operate from business model (vertical integration) to the clothing worn by workers (no pockets) and the brand name (nothing that screams recreational pot). Those restrictions have hardly been a deterrent. The 32 companies submitted a total of 51 applications some are applying in multiple regions and each bid required a detailed proposal and a nonrefundable $10,000 application fee by the June deadline. The response so far exceeded the expectations of the states Board of Pharmacy that it says it wont decide permits until late September. The state plans to award one permit for each of five regions. Those chosen for conditional permits will have a year to get up and running. A one-year permit will cost $60,000. Much of the selection process is under wraps, with the state maintaining that the identities of applicants are exempt from Virginias Freedom of Information Act. A few of the hopefuls have gone public as theyve pitched their projects to local officials, whose buy-in will be a factor as the committee weighs applications. Among them: a mom-and-pop pharmacist hoping to set up shop in a shuttered J.C. Penney near the Tennessee border and a Hampton home builder seeking to operate out of a former NASA lab. The latter would partner with Arizona Organix, which opened that states first dispensary in 2012. At least two other contenders with out-of-state operations are in the mix. One is PharmaCann, which is based in the Chicago area and operates in Illinois, New York, Massachusetts and Maryland, and is licensed and in the process of building in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. The other out-of-state operator is Surterra Wellness, which is licensed in Florida and Texas and backed by venture capitalists, including chewing-gum heir William Beau Wrigley Jr., who was named chairman of the board this month. It has applied for three of Virginias permits. One would operate out of greenhouses in Waynesboro, the other two in industrial warehouses in Prince William and Amelia counties. Of all the known contenders, Surterra has pushed for medical marijuana in Richmond since 2014. The company donated a total of $50,000 to Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and his predecessor, Terry McAuliffe (D), and is represented by Richmond lobbying powerhouse McGuireWoods. Andrew Smith, who was McAuliffes campaign finance director and later a McGuireWoods vice president, is now a Surterra senior vice president. Surterra founder Jake Bergmann said that if it is selected, the company would invest $10million to $20million in Virginia in the first year and hire a couple hundred employees. At the other end of the spectrum is Dharma Pharmaceuticals, which takes pride in being a purely local start-up. While established outfits have executives and specialists such as master growers, a from-scratch operation will need all new hires, boosting the local economy, said Michael Johnson, a pharmacist in the southwest Virginia community of Abingdon who is leading Dharmas effort. I think thats a benefit for the region, said Johnson, whose group plans to occupy a former J.C. Penneys at the defunct Bristol Mall. Virginia looked like a trailblazer when it approved medical marijuana for people with certain illnesses in 1979. A year earlier, New Mexico had legalized marijuana for medicinal use, but only for a limited number of patients enrolled in a research study. Virginias law, meant to make marijuana available to patients with glaucoma and cancer, seemed far more sweeping. My recollection was that no other state had done that, said former congressman Rick Boucher (D-Va.), who was then a state senator and the chief sponsor of the bill. The medical marijuana measure, part of a broader package of legislation that eased first-offense penalties for possessing or growing small amounts of marijuana, drew little attention or controversy at the time. And it was soon forgotten, because it proved to be useless: It required patients to have a doctors prescription for marijuana, something doctors could not prescribe since it was illegal under federal law. The law drew attention nearly 20 years later, when Del. Robert G. Marshall (R-Prince William) led a repeal effort, but a Senate committee was persuaded to keep it on the books. As other states legalized medical if not recreational marijuana, Virginia resisted the trend. But law-and-order legislators started budging after a 2013 CNN documentary, Weed, showed the plight of a family seeking marijuana oil to control their daughters seizures. The program instantly reshaped the legalization argument into a family-values tear-jerker. Virginia legislators heard from a mother who had moved to Colorado so her daughter could obtain the oils there legally, leaving another daughter behind in Virginia until the strain on the family proved too much. In front of legislators at one hearing, a girl had a seizure. Even so, instead of legalizing the oil, Virginia lawmakers in 2015 passed a measure that would provide only an affirmative defense to shield epileptics and their guardians from prosecution. Provisions for producing the oils in-state had to be scrapped that year, forcing parents to rely on the black market or risk prosecution for buying the oils elsewhere and illegally transporting them across state lines. In the years since, the legislature has loosened the rules so that now the state is preparing for in-state production of the oils, authorized not just for epilepsy but for any medical condition that a doctor thinks can be helped. Patients will need a recommendation rather than a prescription from a physician, and both patient and doctor must register with the state. Jenn Michelle Pedini, executive director of Virginia NORML, said the commonwealths approach is among the strictest in the nation. But among the states operating under hyper-restrictive models, Virginia is sort of the best of the worst, Pedini said, noting that the state will allow the oils to contain up to 5percent THC, compared with 0.5percent in Texas. The state requires that companies grow their own marijuana, produce the oil and sell it all at one location. One contender compares that mandate to requiring that Jim Beam not only grow its own corn, rye and barley, but also do so in the same spot where it distills, bottles and sells its bourbon. The vertical setup is fairly unusual and intended to ensure quality and control the product, Pedini said. Florida has similar requirements, and critics contend that they create huge barriers to entry and limit competition, leading to higher prices and legal drug cartels, as the Tampa Bay Times has put it. The regulations do allow for delivery after patients have an initial, in-person consultation with the companys on-site pharmacist. But the companies have to run the delivery service themselves. Pedini predicts that some of Virginias restrictions will fall away as the state grows more comfortable with the industry. And that is precisely what worries conservatives like Marshall, who lost his reelection bid in 2017 and was shocked to learn that both houses of the legislature voted unanimously this year to broaden use of the oils beyond epileptics. This is like these wagons that went through the Old West, these hucksters who said, This will cure X, Y and Z, he said. This is experimentation, and if its for any illness, this is really wide open."

(Susan Fry) Star, a petite 6-year-old sheltie who competes in dog agility shows, almost missed a contest this month.She had spent the previous night at the vet, totally stoned on pot. Her drug trip was an accident. Star lives in Oregon, where recreational use of marijuana became legal last year. Her owner's husband had left some loose-leaf pot on the dining room table, and Star got curious. That was days after her sister, Kicker, gobbled upapot-infused hard candy she found in the car, leaving her wobbling and incontinent. A veterinarian gave both dogs activated charcoal to absorb the toxin, which contributed to nearly $3,000 in medical bills and caused Star to poop in the ring during hercompetition. ""It was a bad week,"" said the dogs' owner, Susan Fry, of South Lebanon, Ore. But it was probablya fairly routine week for the clinic that treated the dogs.As more jurisdictions legalize marijuana ,veterinarians across the country say they are seeing a sharp increase in cases of pets accidentally getting high. Tasty ""edibles"" such as muffins and cookies that people consume for a buzz are also appealingto animals, who can't read warning labels, and, in the case of dogs, rarely stop at just one pot brownie. ""Dogs used to kind of chew on the stash growing in the basement. Now they're finding a big bag of gummy bears,"" said Heidi Houchen, a veterinarian at VCA Northwest Veterinary Specialists in a suburb of Portland, which treats a few marijuana cases a week. ""Dogs are Hoovers. Dogs are the rock eaters."" These incidents, which are rarely fatal, have driven a 330 percent increase over the past five years in calls about pets on pot to the Pet Poison Helpline , said Ahna Brutlag, a veterinary toxicologist who is associate director of the Minnesota-based animal poison control center. Two-thirds of the calls involve marijuana edibles, and nearly all involve dogs, she said. Veterinarians also cited examples of chihuahuaslapping upbong water, cats being exposed to vaping, and even rabbits, ferrets and birds getting accidentally stoned. In the year afterpot became legal for recreational use in Oregon,DoveLewis, a large emergency veterinary clinic in Portland, sawa 63 percent increase in marijuana toxicity cases despite a client base growth of just 7 percent,said Alaina Buller, a clinic spokeswoman. Those findings echoed the results of a 2012 study that found such cases quadrupled at two Colorado veterinary clinics in the five years after medical marijuana was legalized in that state. Nigel, a teacup pig with a big appetite, got even hungrier after eating peanut butter cookies that contained marijuana. (Family photo) As several YouTube videos illustrate, baked pets look a lot like really high people:Glassy-eyed, teetering, lethargic and prettypathetic. In the case of Nigel, a 1-year-old pet teacup pig who was vacationing with his family in Nantucketthis summer, it led to a serious case of the munchies. One member of the family none of whom would agree to be identified in this article had recently been in Colorado, where he had acquired pot peanut butter cookies that were in his backpack. Nigel, who was described as having a voracious appetite when sober, rooted them out and left the empty package as evidence. ""Very soon, we had a very stoned pig on our hands,"" said one witness, a 54-year-old writer who lives in New York City. ""He's just wandering around the kitchen desperate for food, doing a lot of whining and oinking. Then eventually, he just passed out."" Animals can sleep off a marijuana high in many cases, according to veterinarians interviewed, all of whomsaid they immediatelysuspect the substance when an incontinent pet shows up.Other common toxins, such ascaffeine or pesticides, can be far more dangerous.But veterinarians say there's growingconcernabout the increased potency of today's marijuana edibles, many of which are made withbutters or oils infused withhighly concentratedtetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Many also contain chocolate, which can be fatal to dogs. Marijuana ingestion by animals can lead to vomiting, racing or slowed heart rates, tremors or even seizures. Veterinarians said it is usually treated by inducing vomiting or administering intravenous fluids or anti-nausea medications. In some cases, medications tocontrol heart rates or tremors are necessary. ""Most of them just need a night of detox,"" said veterinarian Shawn Thomas, who owns Tanasbourne Veterinary Emergenc ynear Portland.Theworst cases, Thomassaid, involve owners who have also partaken. He recalled onestandard poodle that washospitalized for more than two days after devouringTHC-infused butter. Its owner, Thomas said,didn't quickly realize the dog was suffering because""he was blitzed out of his mind, too."" ""Ten years ago, we would have told you there's no chance your dog is going to die of this,"" he said. ""But now, I tell people, it's so much stronger, and you have a four-pound Chihuahua and it could die."" Anson Graves and his girlfriend, Tina Pontiff, were amused and then afraid after Rusty found and ate a pot brownie. (Anson Graves) Anson Graves, whose three-poundChihuahua mix ate most of a pot brownie in August, said he really started to worry when the dog still could not walk 12 hours later.Rusty had fallenunder the influence accidentally, according toGraves, a 25-year-old waiter amid the revelry of Bourbon Street in New Orleans, which recently decriminalized marijuana possession . Graves and his friends had stopped for beers and cocktails known as Hand Grenades when, he said, he looked down to see Rusty inhaling a packaged brownie lying on the curb. The labelindicated it contained 60 milligrams of THC, he said. ""I've had my experiences,"" said Graves, who lives in Patterson, La. ""That's quite a bit for a dog."" Watch more! Anson Graves filmed this video of his dog, Rusty, after the dog ate a pot brownie it found on a New Orleans street in August. (Anson Graves) Half an hour later, Rusty was so lethargic that Graves headed home. The next morning, he was ""like a slinky,"" said Graves, who posted a video of the stoned dog on his Facebook page. He called his vet, who advised rehydrating Rusty by offering himPedialyte.That helped, but the dog wasn't fully recovered until the fourth day, Graves said. ""He was trying to run and jump on the bed. But he'd just hit the bed,"" said Graves, who added that Rusty's New Orleans visits are over.""That was too much hassle."" The upshot to wideninglegalization and tolerance of marijuana, veterinarians say, is that pet owners now readily admit when they know their animals have consumed it. In some cases, they even acknowledgehaving given their pets pot for medical purposes, said Lisa Parshley, a veterinary oncologist in Olympia, Wash. Veterinarians are not allowed to prescribe medical marijuana, but Parshley said she had a client who used her own topical cannabis balm on her dog, which had end-stage cancer. ""The dog got a little drunk on the THC,"" said Parshley. ""I convinced her to reduce the dose, and darn if the dog didn't do well for almost another month."" Veterinarians say the biggest lesson from the increase in stoned pet patients is an obvious one: Pot, like any potentially dangerous substance, needs to be kept out of a pet's reach. Fry said she's now enforcing that with her husband, John, who she said began using marijuana when he contracted multiple sclerosis 30 years ago before it was legal in Oregon.He ""isn't noted for being a super clean guy,"" she said, explaining why he'd left the candy in the car cupholder and the pot on the dining room table. Kicker, the candy-eater, had a particularly strong reaction that left Fry who said she tried marijuana once and was not a fan in tears and worried she would lose the ""feisty little thing."" But both dogs bounced back Star so well that she performed two of her agility events flawlessly justtwo days after her inadvertent overdose. Next month, both dogs are competing at a national event in Arizona where, luckily for them, there are no drug tests.

(U.S. Senate Drug Caucus) Attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) is a fervent foe of marijuana legalization . But if he were confirmed as President-elect Trump's top law enforcement official, would he really have any power to put his anti-pot views into practice? To review the postelection state of play , a majority of states have legalized medical marijuana and eight (plus the District of Columbia) have legalized recreational marijuana. But the federal Controlled Substances Act still defines production and sale of marijuana as serious crimes. The Obama administration issued policy memos that curtailed federal enforcement of marijuana laws in legalization states. But because such executive branch directives do not bind successive administrations in any way, an Attorney General Sessions could immediately come down on the marijuana industry like a 400 pound bale of pot. One could hardly imagine easier criminal cases for federal prosecutors to make. New York University professor Mark Kleiman points out that ""Every legally licensed marijuana seller filled out and signed a form that documents their intent to commit a federal felony."" In addition to arresting the owners and operators of marijuana selling companies, Sessions would have broad power under federal law to seize their assets. Actual federal prosecutions may not even be necessary: Simply threatening the industry with aggressive enforcement may be sufficient to induce producers and sellers to close up shop and lead investors to direct their money elsewhere. Would anything constrain Sessions from putting the marijuana industry out of business? In the case of medical marijuana, the answer is almost certainly yes. The prior Congress used the power of the purse to prevent any federal enforcement against medical marijuana sellers and users, and the next Congress will probably be of a similar mind. The Department of Justice therefore couldn't even pay the postage on a letter from the attorney general ordering federal prosecutors into action against medical marijuana providers, no matter how egregiously they flout federal law. The recreational marijuana industry does not enjoy comparable protection because it's concentrated in a smaller number of states and is tied to the political party that was thrashed on election night. The four newly legalizing states (California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada) backed Clinton, and the one state to reject legalization (Arizona) plumped for Trump. With the exception of Alaska, the places that previously legalized recreational marijuana are Democratic Party strongholds (The District of Columbia, Oregon and Washington State). Given those realities, and the fact that political donations by marijuana legalization lobbying groups and the industry go overwhelmingly to Democrats , any political collateral damage of a crackdown may be seen more as a feature than a bug by a Republican-controlled federal government. More generally, although a majority of Americans say they support marijuana legalization when asked by a pollster, that doesn't mean consider it a political priority. Former marijuana policy lobbyist Dan Riffle describes support for legalization as "" a mile wide and an inch deep ."" He adds ""voters don't care enough to march in the streets about it."" Could the federal response to legal recreational marijuana be something other than Obama's hands-off approach or an industry-wide shutdown? Drug policy analyst Jonathan Caulkins proposes a third way: ""Trump and Sessions could announce national standards for acceptable industry behavior and condition nonenforcement on compliance by marijuana sellers. For example, Sessions could effectively ban marijuana products that are combined with alcohol or tobacco, or which are packaged to look like candies and sodas. Aggressive marketing tactics, such as giving away free grams to entice new customers, could also be blocked."" Caulkins's vision of the federal government's enforcement role honors the voters' wish to have recreational marijuana legalized while at the same time limiting corporate profit-seeking tactics that could harm public health. Few people expect Sessions to be that Solomonic, but then again not many people expected Nixon to go to China either. 0 Comments Keith Humphreys is a Professor of Psychiatry at Stanford University and is an affiliated faculty member at Stanford Law School and the Stanford Neurosciences Institute."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/business/2018/08/30/republican-lawmakers-this-us-territory-just-voted-legalize-marijuana/,washingtonpost.com,Republican lawmakers in this U.S. territory just voted to legalize marijuana,Christopher Ingraham,09-30-2018,,"The House and Senate of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), a U.S. territory in the Pacific Ocean near Guam , have approved legislation to legalize the recreational use of marijuana and allow commercial sale of the drug. If Republican Gov. Ralph Deleon Guerrero Torres signs the bill, it would make CNMI the first U.S. territory to allow recreational marijuana use, as well as the first locality in the United States to create a commercial marijuana market via legislative action rather than via a voter-driven ballot initiative. This year, lawmakers in Vermont approved a marijuana legalization measure that included no provision for commercial sales. The CNMI bill passed with overwhelming support in both chambers of government: The vote in the House was 18 to 1, with one abstention, while the Senate vote was 6 to 0 with two abstentions . A majority of lawmakers in both chambers are Republican. The population of the Northern Mariana Islands stood at about 52,000 as of July 17 , slightly smaller than the population of Bethesda, Md. But legalization advocates are nonetheless cheering the move. This is a historic moment, as it is the first time a governing body in the United States has ever enacted legislation to both end marijuana prohibition and establish a system of regulation to replace it, Karen OKeefe, director of state policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a statement. Gerry Hemley, co-founder of Sensible CNMI, the group spearheading the initiative in the Northern Mariana Islands, said in a statement that this is an opportunity for the commonwealth to establish itself as a trendsetter on this issue and set an example for the states and other U.S. territories. The CNMI vote comes as the White House is considering ramping up its rhetoric against marijuana use , and the attorney general has rescinded the previous administrations protections for state-legal marijuana businesses. But states that have already legalized recreational marijuana have vowed to protect their own nascent marijuana industries from federal interference. And in November, voters in Michigan and North Dakota will decide whether to legalize recreational use of the drug, while voters in Utah and Missouri will consider medical marijuana proposals. Lawmakers in New Jersey, meanwhile, are considering their legalization bill , and New York's legislature is likely to consider their legalization bill next year . Recreational marijuana sales are expected to begin nationwide in Canada later this year. It appears the Northern Mariana Islands is in good company as they disregard federal saber-rattling on marijuana legalization."

Randall's regular marijuana supply was cut off several months ago when his ophthalmologist, who provided him with the drug under a government research program, moved out of the Washington area. The settlement was reached this week in connection with a lawsuit that Randall had filed against the U.S. Randall, 30, contended in the suit that laws and policies regulating marijuana distribution denied him his constitutional right to his health. Under the agreement, Randall's current eye doctor will be allowed to supply him with marijuana for at least two years through a Public Health Service pharmacy, according to court records and the U.S. Attorney's office. The drug is supplied to the pharmacy in connection with medical research projects sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the U.S. attorney's office said.

Bernardo suggested that student government leaders could help end the spate of drug arrests in the county schools by exerting ""peer pressure"" on their fellow-students and persuading them to stop smoking marijuana. Yesterday, the student government leaders said they had a better plan for stopping the arrests; the state, they said, should decriminalize marijuana use. ""For millions of young people who are defined as criminals under the current marijuana laws, these laws only increase their disrespect and bitterness for the entire legal system,"" said John Heilprin, a junior at Walt Whitman High School. ""They resent being defined as criminals in a society which permits, and even encourages through advertising, the use of such proven unhealthy and dangerous drugs as alcohol and tobacco,"" added Heilprin, who drafted a resolution passed by more than half of the 100 high school delegates assembled for a regular meeting yesterday. The resolution, however, said that students who smoke marijuana on school grounds or during school hours should be subject to the same severe school penalties that now cover students who drink alcohol at school. As the students were convening, however, Montgomery County police officers were arresting eight young people on drug charges. The arrests at three high schools brought to 139 the number of young people arrested since the police began cracking down on drug use at county schools last month. Yesterday, two Gaithersburg High School students and three Sherwood High School students were arrested and charged with possession of marijuana. Three others were charged with possession of PCP. Charged with possession of PCP are 19-year-old Gerald Garland Weaver, 8701 Woodfield Ct., Gaithersburg; a 17-year-old student at Damascus High School, and a 17-year-old girl who recently graduated from Damascus High School. The three were arrested in a car near Damascus, where police followed them after allegedly spotting the three using drugs in the school parking lot. The 17-year-old girl also was charged with concealing a deadly weapon. Police said she had a sawed-off shotgun, a .22 automatic rifle and a 16-gauge shotgun. The weapons were not registered. Yesterday's passage of the decriminalization resolution by the Montgomery County Regional Association of Student Councils proves the way for the Maryland Association of Students Councils to consider the same question at its convention this fall. If the resolution is passed there, the association's legislative council would lobby state legislators to pass a measure to decriminalize marijuana. But Alan Goldstein, a lawyer for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said decriminalization of marijuana by a state might not have much effect on juveniles. ""The decriminalization bill that we have before the legislature has always been limited to the statute that affects adults,"" he said. ""It would make possession of marijuana a civil infraction like a parking violation. Juveniles might still be brought before juvenile court."" In another resolution, passed yesterday, students said that drugs should not be used on school grounds, even if marijuana is eventually decriminalized. They called use of drugs during school hours a source of ""concern and abhorrence."" But they asked for an end to ""police-initiated"" arrests of students using drugs until student delegates meet school officials and police to discuss alternate ways of curbing drug use during school hours. In that resolution students also asked for durg education programs for adults as well as students. ""Some parents have to learn that smoking marijuana isn't the same as shooting up heroin,"" Heilprin said."

In a recently completed Gallup Poll, majorities of the public agree not only that it is physicially harmful (55 per cent) and addicitive (59 per cent) but also that it leads to hard drugs (59 per cent) such as heroin. While these findings are doubtless discouraging to marijuana advocates, the percentage of Americans who believe the substance is harmful (down 11 points) and who think it leads to hard drug use (down 16 points) have both declined significantly since 1972. The percentage who believe it is phsically addictive has remained at about the same level as recorded in 1972. Analysis of the findings for all three questions - is marijuana physically harmful, is it habit forming, does it lead to hard drug use - reveals sharp contrasts in attitudes by sex, edication, age, and region of the nation. [WORD ILLEGIBLE] each of these population groups is generally the same on all three questions. For example: Men are more likely to agree with the pro-marijuana viewpoint on all questions than are women; The higher the education of the respondent, the more likely one is to hold a pro-marijuana viewpoint. In all three cases, those with only a grade school education are the most conservative in their beliefs, with the high school-educated falling between; Younger adults (under 30) are most likely to have a pro-marijuana viewpoint wiht the 30-49-year-old group significantly more anti-marijuana, and those over 50 years old most convinced of its harmful qualities; People living in the Northeast and far West are more apt, on all three questions, to have a pro-marijuana viewpoint than are Midwesterners and Southeners. Yesterday, the Gallup Poll reported that the percentage of Americans who have sample marijuana at least once has risen to 24 per cent with about half these having tried it during the last year. Analysis of the views of persons who have tried marijuana reveals a not unecpected consistency. Those who have never tried marijuana are, in all three cases, more likely to accept the anti-marijuana view than are users. And among users, those whose contact with the substance was more than one year ago have uniformly more anti-marijuana views than currents users."

But even before his drug abuse message to Congress was made public, the President's White House adviser on drug abuse, Dr. Peter Bourne, told reporters that federal decriminalization of marijuana is ""not that important in the big picture"" and that its significance in the message ""is more symbolic than real."" The bulk of the message, when Carter introduced in a personal appearance in the White House press briefing from dealt with a series of studies and directives aimed at expanding and strengthening federal drug abuse efforts and placing coordination of those efforts under the White House. The President did not propose administration legislation to decriminalize marijuana, nor did he urge the states to end their own criminal penalties for possession of a small amount of the drug - generally defined as one ounce of less. Instead, he said he would leave it up to the states to enact or repeal their own laws and he supported legislation pending in Congress that would impose federal civil penalties rather than criminal penalties for the possession of an ounce or less of marijuana. Federal law now has a penalty of one year in prison, a $5,000 fine or both for possession of marijuana. There is no federal civil penalty for possession. There are currently two Capitol Hill dealing with the subject. One would simply end the criminal penalty of a $100 fine for possession. In effect, Carter endorsed the latter measure, whose chief sponsors are Sens. Jacob K. Javits (R-N.Y) and Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). The President, whose three sons have acknowledged experimenting with marijuana, primised during his campaign last year to seek to desriminalize marijuana. In doing so yesterday, however, he appeared to take the most cautious approach open to him - endorsing pending legislation rather than proposing his own and stopping short of urgin the states, which prosecute almost all marijuana offenders, to follow suit. According to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, a Washington-based lobbying group, in 1975 there were 416,000 arrests under state laws for possession of marijuana. Of these, 93 per cent were for possession of a small amount - generally one ounce or less. That same year, there were 4,000 arrests under the federal law Carter seeks to change, almost all of them involving traffickers who possessed more than one ounce, according to the organization. The White House estimated that 45 million Americans have experimented with marijuana and that 11 million use the drug regularly. In a telephone interview, Bourne said that while the President did not urge the states to decriminalize possession of marijuana, his endorsement of the pending federal legislation ""signals certain message."" Some proposals in the message may draw criticism from civil libertarians. Carter, for example, ordered a Justice Department study of the possibility of denying release from jail before trial of persons charged with major drug trafficking offenses. he also ordered studies on the possibility of revoking the passports and freezing the financial assets of known drug traffickers, and of easing restrictions on government access to personal financial data of known drug dealers. The President also ordered studies on the use of barbiturates, including the prescribing practices of physicians, an audit of drug manufacturing frims and the use of sedative hypnotic drugs that are particularly subject to abuse. Bourne said he considered the President's emphasis on international cooperation to eliminate the sources of such drugs as heroin to be among the must important aspects of the message. ""Even under optimum circumstances, only about 10 per cent of the heroin can be eliminated by law enforcement efforts,"" Bourne said. The rest must be eliminated at the source of the drug in foreign countries , among them Mexico, he said."

A female legislator became enraged by the statements of Ann Arbor's State Rep. Perry Bullard, who his made marijuana decriminalization a personal crusade, Calling Bullard a ""pot smoker,"" she picked up an ashtray and gave her colleague a whack on the head. Bullard wasn't seriously injured. Nor has political retribution been visited on legislator who've decided it makes no sense to burden offenders - mostly young people - with the stigma of prison sentences and criminal records for possessing small amounts of grass. ""No legislator in the state of Oregon has been defeated because of his vote for decriminalization. Not one, ""Oregon State Sen. Ed Bagley told a National Conference of State Legislators panel in Detroit last month. Nine states have eased up dramatically on their marijuana laws, generally making it a simple civil infraction if a person is caught with an ounce or less of the drug. Oregon was the first state to act, in 1973, Alaska, California, Maine, Colorado, Minnesota and just this year, Mississippi, New York and North Carolina have followed. As a result, fully a third of the American people can now smoke the onetime symbol of decadence, evil and '60s radicalism without fear of anything more serious than a $100 fine, given out like a traffic citation. The decrimination effort received a major boost recently when President Carter, making good on a campaign promise, asked Congress to reduce the federal penalty for possession of an ounce of marijuana from a $5,000 fine, a year in jail, or both, to a civil fine - probably $100. The President's stand should help persuade a still-reluctant Congress to change the federal law, says Keith Stroup, founder of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML). Even more important, Stroup says, the presidential stamp of approval should help persuade legislators to change state laws under which as astounding 416,000 marijuana arrests were made in 1975 - 93 per cent for possessing a small amount. ""People know that Jimmy Carter is not a social liberal,"" Stroup notes. ""He's a compassionate man who has three sons who admit they have been marijuana users in the past - one of whom received a less-than-honorable discharge from the Navy as a result. His kids are not criminals, they're decent people. The fact that Jimmy Carter has come to grips with this on a personal basis makes it far easier for a lot of people to come to grips with it as well."" By 53 to 41 per cent, Americans favor removing criminal penalities for possessing small amounts of marijuana, the Gallup Poll says. What's causing the more lenient public attitude? There seem to be three major reasons: Widely reported evidence that experimental or intermittent use of marijuana does not cause physical or psychological harm of dependency. Even with decriminalization, usage doesn't rise appreciably - only 3 per cent, Oregon and California studies indicate. No brain damage from marijuana use has been documented, unlike the well proven brain damage of alcohol. A growing feeling that stiff laws alone will never stamp out marijuana use. ""If we were to round up every kid in Sunflower County who smoked marijuana, we wouldn't have enough left to hold Sunday school,"" C.O. Sessums Jr., president of the Mississippi legislature. And the drug, notes Dr. Peter Bourne, Carter's assistant for health matters, can be cultivated in every state. Increasing belief that jail and a permanent criminal record are more harmful to the marijuana user than the drug. There are stories of person rapes and even suicide among jailed marijuana users. ""Our prisons are overcrowded, and yet were sending kids to jail for minor pot offenses. It just didn't make sense,"" says State Rep. Alan Adams, chief sponsor of North Carolina's decriminalization statute. Decriminating marijuana, advocates say, frees up criminal justice money and staff to deal with more serious drug problems and serious crimes. California localities saved an estimated $25 million in court costs in six months following decriminalization - and also earned $800,000 in fines. Drug control, Bourne says, should concentrate on life-endangering drugs. ""People die from heroin, barbiturates, a minimal amount from cocaine, quite a bit from other hypnotic drugs and not at all from marijuana,"" he notes. But he opposes full legalization of marijuana: ""If you legalize it, it will be pushed, commercialized, condoned and people will encourage its use, which we don't want to do."" It's undersirable, Bourne says, to have young people intoxicated with the drug for a significant percentage of the time, and there's an apparently of the time, and there's an apparently high correlation between marijuana and auto accidents. Up to now, opposition to decriminalization has been strong in many states. Maryland, Missouri, Maine, New Jersey, New Hampshire and New Mexico all have turned down milder penalties since the decriminalization drive began. The issue's still pending this year in Michican and Wisconsin. ""We're not going to go out and lobby the states for decriminalization,"" Bourne told me. But the President's position, he hopes, will ""set a tone with some kind of impact on leadership in state legislatures around the country."""

Gone are the traveling cannabis caravans of doctors infamous for signing up hundreds of medical marijuana hopefuls in a single day. The vast majority of the nearly 30,000 patients and 4,900 providers that once flooded this state of just more than 1 million people have been driven out of Montanas medical marijuana program, which was first legalized in 2004. These days, those who remain in the states medical marijuana system deal in a combination of currency and uncertainty as they await the outcome of a state Supreme Court case that could cripple whats left of the industry. A decision could come as soon as October, according to James Goetz, a lawyer who represents the medical marijuana industry. Depending on the courts ruling, medical marijuana providers could be banned from charging patients a penny, save recouping $50 license fees and renewals. Providers could be limited to three patients each. And the businesses could be blocked from advertising. As medical marijuana consumers cry foul, state legislators and grassroots opposition have sought to undermine the industry, saying business grew too large, too fast in effect becoming recreational marijuana operating under the guise of medicine. Marijuana has been contested in the state so long that people dont recognize the direness of the situation this time around, according to Elizabeth Pincolini, who runs a referral service based in Billings that connects patients to the few doctors left willing to regularly write marijuana recommendations. Elizabeth Pincolini is a medical marijuana user and advocate, who aims to connect patients with doctors. (Martin do Nascimento/News 21) Its really out of our hands, Pincolini said. Theres nothing we can do. We can write letters and do our best to appeal to the common sense of the Supreme Court, but we really cant do anything. A medical marijuana program in turmoil After Montanans in 2004 voted 62percent to38 percent to legalize medical marijuana, the program grew at first in small spurts. But it ballooned in late 2009, after the U.S. Department of Justice said it wouldnt interfere with state-compliant medical marijuana patients and providers. From 3,921 patients and 1,403 providers in September 2009 one month before the Justice Department announcement the program grew to 29,948 patients and 4,848 providers by March 2011. As the system swelled and pot shops opened a stones throw from schools in Butte and across the street from churches in Billings, an opposition movement was born. There were medical marijuana distribution sites next to churches and the junior high, said Steve Zabawa, a prominent funder of the anti-marijuana movement in Billings, where he owns a chain of car dealerships. You could just see that the traffic going in and out had nothing to do with medicine. Basically, the black market went to the regular market, and it popped up everywhere. In March 2011, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration conducted raids across the state, the culmination of an 18-month investigation into whether the medical marijuana businesses were involved in large-scale drug trafficking and other federal crimes. Shops were closed down, and their operators went on to be charged under federal drug laws. The DEA did not return multiple calls for comment. Several attempts at legislative repeal of medical marijuana followed the raids, targeting the few businesses still open. The program came a signature away from dissolution in April 2011, when then-Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat, vetoed a repeal bill passed by the Legislature. Later in that same legislative session, lawmakers pushed through SB 423 widely known as repeal in disguise, which was signed into law in May 2011. Under the law, providers couldnt charge a cent for services, save recouping license application fees, so they had no incentive to stay open. The laws future now hinges on the outcome of the Supreme Court decision. Nearly 30,000 patients had been reduced to less than 9,000 by June 2012. The restrictive law, which limited each provider to three patients, cut the number of providers to less than 400, down from a June 2011 height of nearly 5,000. Dubbed one of the most restrictive laws in the country by Roy Kemp, interim administrator of the agency that regulates the medical marijuana program, SB 423 allows for providers, but not dispensaries. Larger providers allowed for now under a judges order operate storefronts with regular hours. They stock assorted strains, from Blue Dream to OG Kush to Black Cherry Soda. They have registers full of cash and stickers with logos and menus with prices. But they cant technically refer to their operations as a dispensary. They cant technically call what they do business. Its interesting that they call dispensary a loaded term, said Carly Dandrea, a budtender for Around the Clock Cannabis in Bozeman and a fifth-generation Montanan. I take offense to that. Its what we do. Its who we are. The law doesnt give the state much leeway. There are no dispensaries that exist in the state of Montana, Kemp said. The law doesnt allow for them. Thats not what we do here. A contentious legal history has led the industry to the shaky ground on which it today stands. After members of the marijuana industry sued to block SB 423, state District Judge James Reynolds, in June 2011 blocked three of the most restrictive measures of the states medical marijuana law: a ban on providers charging patients except to recover small license and renewal fees, a ban on advertising and a maximum of three patients per provider. But the Montana State Supreme Court ordered Reynolds to reassess the law under a less-strict standard. In January 2013, Reynolds confirmed his original ruling in a second temporary injunction and he made the ruling permanent in January 2015. Montana Attorney General Tim Fox appealed that ruling, the states Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments once more and briefs have been filed by both sides. Fox and his attorneys have defended SB 423 by arguing that Reynolds erred in interpreting the law. A spokesman for Fox declined to make the attorney general available for comment, saying it would be inappropriate with litigation pending. The outcome of the Supreme Court case could bring about the end of an era and of an industry. Its hard for patients to live like that, not knowing if theyll have their cards next year, Pincolini said. She added, Its pretty desperate. Its a pretty desperate situation. As 23 states, plus Washington, D.C., have eased restrictions on medical marijuana with more expected to follow Montana has been the only one to head in the opposite direction. Montana seems to be the only state that seems to be going backwards after having had a medical marijuana law, said Mort Reid, the president of the Montana Cannabis Industry Association, a trade group and party in the Supreme Court case. The other states seem to be moving forward. So, the big question is, What makes Montana different from other states, and why cant they make it work in Montana? State Sen. David Howard, a Republican, supported attempts to repeal or restrict marijuana in the 2011 legislative session when he served in the House. Calling marijuana a scourge coming to America, Howard helped lead the movement against the drug in Montana. It doesnt take you very long to figure out that (marijuana is) not medicine, Howard said, adding that hes still for repeal of the 2004 law today. Thats what they wanted you to think it was medicine. It has no practical applications, and it was tearing apart Montana. Zabawa, the Billings car dealer, has tried in the past to gather enough signatures for a marijuana repeal initiative on the ballot, but fell short of the necessary number in 2014. Hes now gathering signatures for another voter initiative supporting all-out repeal of medical marijuana in the 2016 election. The remnants of the raids In the middle of a Monday morning, March 11, 2011, Mark and Valerie Sigler, husband and wife co-owners of Big Sky Patient Care, one of the largest medical marijuana providers in the state, pulled up to their location near Bozeman to check in on things. But the open sign was off. The parking lot was empty. Something wasnt quite right. Stepping inside, the couple was greeted by rifle-wielding, riot-gear-wearing federal agents standing watch over a handful of employees handcuffed on the ground. The Siglers had waltzed right into the middle of their own personal federal drug raid. Id probably have been shot today, because I was in their faces screaming at them, telling them that we were state-compliant, said Valerie Sigler, still shaking more than four years later. So, what were they doing there? The Siglers operation was one dozens of businesses raided across Montana by federal authorities that day. Many providers went on to face federal charges, and almost all accepted probation or house arrest to avoid jail time. The Siglers received five years of probation, which theyre both still serving, plus suspended jail time for Mark and house arrest for both. But becoming felons was just the beginning. From 400-plus patients and more than $1 million in the bank, the middle-aged couple have sunk into more than $1 million in debt including a combined $900,000 judgment, payable to the federal government. Their seven grown children, most of whom used to work in the family marijuana business, have been scattered across different states, working odd jobs far from home. Mark and Valerie Sigler walk in the woods surrounding their home outside Bozeman, Mont. (Martin do Nascimento/News 21) The Siglers are about to lose their home, a log cabin in the middle of the forest near Bozeman. Mortgage payments have been hard for a couple of felons lacking a steady income. Mark, a cancer patient, is unemployed. Valerie is back at school, piling on more debt in a bid to turn things around with a dual-degree in geology and liberal arts from Montana State University. You can just keep going, or you can shoot yourself in the head. But you dont have very many choices other than that, Mark Sigler said. Its never going to go away for us. Well, lets face it we were all illegal, he added. Still selling, but quietly, this time Tucked in the corner of a nondescript office park on the edge of Missoula, the woman behind a small medical marijuana operation quietly harvests a dozen plants each month to keep her 70 patients supplied with product. There are no pot leaf stickers marking the spot, no searchable blurbs on Leafly or Weedmaps, no strain menus to peruse within. From the outside, its as if the business never existed. The owner, a wary middle-aged women who has been there since 2009, likes it that way. Nightmares of the raids of 2011 remain. She watched as two businesses in the same office park were raided, product destroyed in the street, charges filed and lives upended. The owner of the Missoula dispensary tends to marijuana plants which are grown in the same location as the storefront. (Martin do Nascimento/News 21) Anytime someone got in the limelight, they were picked off, said the woman, who asked not to be identified for fear of federal prosecution. Whac-a-Mole, thats what it reminded me of. Anytime you stuck your head up, it was like, Whack! Most of the industry today keeps a lower profile than it once did. Providers have reduced hundreds of patients to dozens, or even handfuls. Millions of dollars in revenue has fallen into the thousands. The downsizing has been driven by recurring fears of federal interference into what the state is permitting for now. The 442 providers down from a 2011 high of nearly 5,000 still around are careful. They say they have to be. Out east, Billings, the largest city in Montana, with a population of just under 110,000, is home to just one storefront. The dozens of dispensaries that once dotted the streets are all gone, run out of business by raids and regulation. Rich Abromeit and Jason Smith, owners of the last marijuana storefront within the city limits, Montana Advanced Caregivers, rattle off a laundry list of protections checking cards meticulously, keeping patient and plant counts in check, staying away from illegal edible extractions they say have kept them out of trouble since they opened the shop in 2008. Im a bulls-eye, Smith said, glancing behind his back at rows of labeled pot plants. Im the last shop left in this town, and everyone depends on me. Buying illegally outside the system Jon Svaren, a bearded 15-year Navy veteran, has been living out on his aunts farm off dirt roads near Hardin, in the eastern part of the state, where attitudes toward marijuana tend to be harsher. Svaren breaks the law more days than not. Hes an unapologetic pot-smoker, self-medicating for a spinal fusion and years of back pain that intensify with long hours of labor logged feeding sheep and tending to crops. The pot comes from the black market. Vaporizing, as is his preference, four to five times a day could land him in jail. Not that he cares much. Put me before a jury of 12, Svaren said, between swigs of homemade lemonade served cold from a Vlasic pickle jar. Id be happy to explain myself to them. The tens of thousands of patients who have left the system havent stopped smoking, he said, smirking at the idea. Theyve gone to the black market, where there is no registry, no threat of the state turning against the system once more. In turning to the black market, many find an ironic sense of safety. An open violation type of guy, the libertarian-leaning Svaren refused to renew his medical card after the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in 2011 prohibited medical marijuana patients from owning firearms. Svaren, who likes to go duck-hunting and keeps an eye out for bears wandering through the farm (its happened before), has quite the gun collection. Though Svaren ditched the system early, others, too, are planning for a future with limited options for procuring marijuana if the Supreme Court rules against the industry. Because providers would be prohibited from making a profit, the black market or growing at home would be the only viable option for patients, according to Josh Daniels, a patient advocate living in the suburbs of Billings. Home-growing, though, presents problems of its own. The law doesnt allow patients a legal way to procure seeds or clones. Hows that supposed to work? asked Daniels, between deep drags of a hand-rolled cigarette. Hes also a patient, growing marijuana to deal with his multiple sclerosis. A magic seed fairy is going to deliver seeds in your mailbox? To grow, the first thing you have to do is break the law. Les Yother, a recently retired 63-year-old former laborer, lives a couple hundred miles west of Daniels and Svaren, a long, winding ride on Interstate 90 away, across two-lane stretches that meander through an empty expanse of green dotted with the occasional farm. Miles pass between each exit until his hometown, Butte, once known as the richest hill on Earth for its vastly profitable copper mines, comes into view. As Montanasmedical marijuana system grew, pot businesses started popping up across from churchesand near schools, including in the city of Butte, shown here. (Martin do Nascimento/News 21) The town of nearly 34,000 has a rough-and-tumble, heavy-drinking history. Here, in the midst of blue-collar households and aging infrastructure, medical marijuana has by and large found a safe haven. Dispensaries downtown still advertise, plastering phone numbers and websites outside. Men linger drinking beer in the middle of the day down a main thoroughfare, Montana Street, taking advantage of a loose open container law. Pot seems to raise few eyebrows. The birthplace of Evel Knievel, Butte tends toward a live-and-let-live attitude when it comes to marijuana a sharp contrast to the other parts of Montana. Yother was one of the first to get a card in 2004, patient 69 in the registry. Since then, Yother said, its gone back and forth so many times that no one can keep track. A former alcoholic, Yother credited marijuana with settling his demons. The cardholder smokes about two grams a day to manage his glaucoma and relieve pain from a bad back that has him hunched almost in half from years of hard labor. If the Supreme Court rules against the industry, Yother would keep on puffing pot out of a residue-streaked green metallic pipe: Oh, Id go black market, he said. Hanging on, industry faces uncertain future Gibbons picks a leaf off of one of his indoor marijuana plants. (Martin do Nascimento/News 21) The direction and destination of marijuana in Montana hangs in the uneasy balance. The status quo has left providers and patients in a vacuum of fear and uncertainty, unsure what the Supreme Court will decide in the months to come. A Reefer Madness poster stared down on Mark Gibbons Jr., the self-proclaimed longest-running provider in Montana as he mulled over what might come next. Gibbons, the owner of Buttes Montana Natural Medicine, which served 500 patients at its height in early 2011, has weathered setbacks before: failed crops, dropped customers. He once cycled through 10 pounds of marijuana per month thats down to two or so, for his 40 remaining patients. Perched behind the counter, beneath an Against SB 423 sticker, opposite a University of Montana diploma tucked between a couple of Yellowstone National Park shot glasses, Gibbons sighed in frustration at shifting regulation he says he still doesnt fully understand. If the court rules against the industry, Gibbons has a backup plan to make ends meet: accepting donations, not payment, from patients, not customers. With a lot of patience and a few creative solutions, cannabis ought to survive in the state, he said. Itll just be less, Gibbons said. Itll be less plants and less money and less patients getting treatment."

(Nick Adams/Reuters) National and local advocates for marijuana policy reform are using a new poll to kick off a major push for the legalization or decriminalization of cannabis in the District one that could include the pursuit of a ballot initiative in 2014. The poll was sponsored by the Marijuana Policy Project, the Drug Policy Alliance and financed by Dr. Bronners Magic Soaps, a company that had backed legalization referendums in four states. Public Policy Polling conducted the automated telephone poll on April 10 and 11, reaching 1,621 registered voters. It showed two-thirds of D.C. registered voters would at least partially support a legalization referendum similar to the ones passed last year in Colorado and Washington state. Three-quarters of poll respondents favored the decriminalization approach adopted by several states and municipalities, which would turn the possession of small amounts of marijuana from a criminal offense to something more akin to a traffic ticket. A January 2010 XXX survey found residents more closely split when asked whether they favored legalizing the possession of marijuana for personal use, with 46 percent in favor to 48 percent opposed. The XXX poll, which carried a three-point margin of error, showed white residents were much more likely to favor legalization (60-35) than black residents (37-55). The new poll, which did not report a margin of error, found a racial disparity, but a less dramatic one. Both white and black residents favored Colorado/Washington-style legalization, though by different degrees 77-19 for whites, 53-38 for blacks. Same goes for the decriminalization question, which was supported by 85 percent of white residents and 69 percent of black residents. There is evidence that national attitudes on marijuana policy have changed in recent years. A Pew Research Center poll released earlier this month found a majority of Americans favored legalization , marking a dramatic shift from even a decade ago, when closer to two-thirds of national poll respondents opposed legalization. Adam Eidinger, a longtime local activist who is employed by Dr. Bronners, said the time has come for city leaders to change District law to reflect popular opinion.Its a popular issue, and up until now the council has ignored it, he said. Maybe now theyll realize the citizens want to to decriminalize at the very least. Officials with the Marijuana Policy Project and Drug Policy Alliance said they will be lobbying the D.C. Council in the coming months to pursue legislative changes. Mason Tvert, MPPs communications director, said his group will be talking to community leaders and elected officials about various options for adopting a more sensible marijuana policy in the District.Bill Piper, director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, said decriminalization would be a no-brainer but legislators should do more. There is an opportunity to make a clean break from the past and treat drug use as a health issue instead of a criminal justice issue, Piper said. The new push comes just as the citys first medical marijuana dispensary is set to open . But city legislators, most notably Council Chairman Phil Mendelson, have been wary of pursuing wide scale decriminalization or legalization or even a more liberal medical marijuana regimeciting the likelihood that federal marijuana laws will remain in effect and the potential response from the citys congressional overseers. There is a good argument for decriminalizing a drug that is widely used and that results in a lot of arrest records and not having an effect on violent crime, Mendelson said in December , but I dont think this is the time for the District to be discussing that. Eidinger said Tuesday that he is prepared to mount a ballot initiative should the council fail to act. He has founded DCMJ a skeleton organization consisting, he says, basically me and a few other people in the city who are interested in advancing the issue. The idea is that we need to create a grassroots organization in the city that is going to advance this ballot initiative if we have to do it, Eidinger said. Meanwhile, [MPP and DPA] will be accelerating their lobbying. I think its unnecessary if the council does their jobs. Piper, of the Drug Policy Alliance, acknowledged internal and external discussions about doing a ballot measure but our preference is to work with the council on a set of reforms to reduce incarceration, racial disparities, and drug overdoses."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/nation/2019/03/10/police-searched-cancer-patients-room-weed-after-someone-called/,washingtonpost.com,Police searched a cancer patients room for marijuana after someone called 911,Lindsey Bever,03-10-2019,,"A Facebook Live video posted March 6 showed police officers in Bolivar, Miss. searching cancer patient Nolan Sousleys medicine bag for marijuana after a 911 call was received by one of the officers. Sousley told the officers that he had taken THC oil pills, but did not have marijuana. When police officers wanted to search Nolan Sousleys medicine bag, he said no. One of the officers said police had received a call that marijuana could be smelled in the hospital room in Bolivar, in western Missouri where the substance is illegal, though medical marijuana will soon be available in the state. Sousley, who said he has Stage 4 pancreatic cancer, told the officers that he had taken THC oil pills in the parking lot of Citizens Memorial Hospital but that he did not have marijuana and he did not want them going through his things. There is no way they could smell it, doc, because I dont smoke it, Sousley said to a medical professional who was in the room Wednesday during a Facebook Live video . The video was streamed from the page Nolans Tribe of Warriors Against Cancer . I dont ever use a ground-up plant. Its an oil that I use in a capsule. Then he told her about his bag of medication. Im not letting them dig through it. It has my final-day things in there, and nobodys going to dig in it, Sousley said, his voice cracking. Sousley said in a subsequent video that he ultimately let one of the officers go through the bag and that no marijuana was discovered. The video of the search, which has been viewed more than 600,000 times, prompted outcry from people advocating for such oils and for Sousley, who has said that he does not know how long he has to live. The Facebook page for Sousley said he was diagnosed around Memorial Day with pancreatic cancer that had metastasized to his liver. He said he takes THC oil to manage pain. A Facebook post from Thursday talked about the viral response. This is what Ive worked for. It finally got here. Here we go fellow fighters. We goin viral. Im gettin calls from weed companies, attorneys I am crying Im so happy. I can quit workin so hard now, it read. The comment added, I told you I was gonna do this and I did. I want the world to see how we treat our own people. Forget immigration we have criminals laying in the hospital I guess. I am so happy. Look what weve done. All of us together. Thank you all so much for caring and believing. Let it go. Let it grow. Amid the uproar, Sousley told the Bolivar Herald-Free Press that he did not blame the police and hopes the incident can be used for good. Bolivar Police Chief Mark Webb told the Herald-Free Press that officers responded to a call last week about possible marijuana in a patients room at Citizens Memorial Hospital and obtained consent to conduct a search. It is not clear who placed the call. But Sousley told the newspaper that a security guard entered his room, saying he could smell marijuana smoke, then phoned police. The Facebook Live video started after police arrived. In the video, an officer is seen searching bags in Sousleys room. During the search, a woman in a white lab coat, whom Sousley referred to in the video as his doctor, asked the officers, Just from a legal standpoint, do you have probable cause to search his stuff? Do you have the right to search his stuff or do you need a warrant for that? Officers told the doctor that they had the right because it was on private property. So whats the proceeding here? she asked them. Because he needs to be here. The officers explained that if they discovered marijuana, they would give Sousley a citation but would not take him to jail. Soon after, the broadcast ended. Webb, the police chief, told the Herald-Free Press that nothing was found. Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment by XXX. After the incident, Tamera Heitz-Peek, a hospital spokeswoman, said in a statement to XXX that respect is part of our core values and our actions in this recent event did not reflect who we are as an organization. We pride ourselves in providing compassionate care to all patients and we fell short of expectations, she said in the statement Sunday. We apologize to our patient and his family and friends who were affected by our actions. We are reviewing the incident and will retrain our employees in the core values and the importance of respect and dignity to our patients and the community. In November, Missourians voted to legalize medical marijuana for patients with serious illnesses or medical conditions. However, the rules and regulations needed to implement the law may not be in place until the summer, and the substance will not be available for purchase until at least January, according to the states Department of Health and Senior Services . Patients with cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, and chronic or terminal conditions may qualify for treatment. Recreational marijuana is illegal in the state. Webb told the Herald-Free Press that his departments social media account has been overrun with negative comments since the incident. In a statement to the newspaper Saturday, Sousley said that we are all human beings and then called on people to treat everyone the way you want to be treated. It is my desire that this entire situation be used for good politicians should stop trying to limit our right to use cannabis and its derivatives, Sousley said in the statement, which was provided to the newspaper by a lawyer with the same last name as his. There are many issues that are demanding the attention of politicians. This is not one of them. He added that he hopes CMH and the City of Bolivar will train officers to treat everyone with whom they interact with respect and refrain from treating people as if they all belong in jail, regardless of economic status, race, culture, religion.

The bill, which activists describe as a first for the Senate, would end the federal prohibition on medical marijuana and implement a number of critical reforms that advocatesof both medical and recreational marijuana have been seekingfor years, according to several people familiar with thedetails of the proposal . It would reclassifythe drugin the eyes of theDrug Enforcement Administration, allow for limited inter-state transport of certain medicines derived from cannabis, expand access to cannabis for research, and makeit easier for doctors to recommend the drug to veteransandeasier for banks to provide services to the industry. Its the most comprehensivemedical marijuana bill in Congress, said Bill Piper, director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, one of several groupsconsulted for the bill. The Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States (CARERS) Act grew outof an amendment proposed last year by Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.). A number of activist organizations deeply involved with passing medical and recreational marijuana laws at the state level were consulted in drafting the bill, including the Drug Policy Alliance, the Marijuana Policy Project, and Americans for Safe Access. And advocates say they are generally pleased with what theyve seen and heard. It really is a comprehensive billit would effectively end the federal war on medical marijuana, said Tom Angell, chairman of the advocacy group Marijuana Majority. But the bill has its detractors. Dr. Kevin Sabet, president of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana,says that while better research and non-smoked medications are necessary, the bill overreaches. Its like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, he said by e-mail. Why not start work with scientists to incentivize research rather than open the floodgates to Big Marijuana? Most major medical organizations oppose smoked pot as medicine because the risks outweigh any benefits. This bill just isnt supported by the science, plain and simple. The following arefive of the bills key provisions, according to several people familiar withit. Under the bill, marijuana would be downgraded one level in the Drug Enforcement Agencys five-category drug classification system . It is currently treated, along with heroin, LSD, and ecstasy, as a Schedule 1 drugthose deemed by the DEA to have no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.The bill would reclassify it asa Schedule 2 drug, joining cocaine, OxyContin, Adderall and Ritalin. The bill would also make it easier to transport some forms of the drugbetween states. While medical marijuana is allowed in 23 states and D.C., another dozen states allow the drug on a much more limited basis. Those states typically allow restricted access to medicine derived from cannabisstrains with low levels of THC, the drugs primary psychoactive component, and high levels of CBD, which is believed to have medicinal benefits. But patients often have no way of accessing such drugs.Thebill would thereforeremove some CBD strains, used to treat epilepsy and seizure disorders, from the federal definition of marijuana. The bill would also make it easier for bankstoprovide services to the marijuana industry as they do to any other. It would reform theprocess by which private researchers can get access to medical marijuana. And it would allow doctors working for the Department of Veterans Affairs in states where medical marijuana is legal to recommend it for certain conditions. The historic bill represents another in a long string of victories for marijuana advocates, who have seen voters legalize the drug for recreational use in four states since 2012: Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington. Nearly half the states have legalizedmedical marijuana and the public support has been growing, with roughly half the nationsupporting legalization according toseveral polls. The political winds have been shifting, too. Three potential Republican presidential candidatesPaul, Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and former Florida governor Jeb Bushhave come out in support of state legalization laws, though theyve hedged on their personal support of such policies."

The bill, to be introduced bySenators Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), would end the federal ban on medical marijuana and implement a series of reforms long sought by advocates. They includedowngrading its status with the Drug Enforcement Agency from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2, allowingdoctors to recommend its use in some cases to veterans, expanding access to researchers and making it easier for banks to provide services to the industry. The Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States (CARERS) Actwouldallow patients, doctors and businesses in states that have already passed medical marijuana laws to participate in those programs without fear of federal prosecution, according to a joint statement from the senators offices. The bill will also make overdue reforms to ensure patients including veterans receiving care from VA facilities in states with medical marijuana programs access the care they need. The proposalwillbe unveiled at a 12:30 p.m. press conference on Tuesday, which will be streamed live here . Patients, their families and advocates will join the senators at the press conference. The announcement was met with praise by advocates. This is a significant step forward when it comes to reforming marijuana laws at the federal level, Dan Riffle, director of federal policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a statement. Its long past time to end the federal ban, said Michael Collins, policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance, said in a statement. Both describe the introduction of the bill as a first for the Senate. Advocates are riding a wave of success in recent years, with voters in four states Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington approving the legalization of the drug for recreational use.The idea has made significant gains in public opinion as well. In December, Congress for the first time in roughly a decade of trying approved an amendment that barsthe Justice Department from using its funds to prevent states from implementing their medical marijuana laws a significant victory for proponents of the practice. Potential Republican presidential candidates Rand, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) have all said they support states rights to legalize pot, though they themselves disagree with the policy. In recent years, several national polls have found majority support for legalizing marijuana. Differences are typically highly split by age the young tend to disproportionately support such policies. Medical marijuana has been approved to varying degrees in 23 states and D.C."

Although limited to just 82 tickets, the data show that officers cited blacks 37 percent of the time, even though just 8 percent of the city is black. Whites make up 70 percent of Seattles population yet received only 50 percent of the fines.More than 1 in 3 of those fined were homeless (i.e. they had no home in which to consume marijuana) or in transitional or low-income housing. The average age of a fine recipient was 33.4. While the sample size is small, it does indicate trends for race and homelessness we should continue to monitor, city council member Nick Licata and City Attorney Pete Holmes said in a joint statement . AD AD After votersapproved marijuana for recreational use in Washington in 2012, the Seattle City Council regulated its public use, mandating in its ordinance that the Seattle Police Departmentmonitor its own enforcement for its race and social justice impacts. Wednesdays study is the result of that policy. The authors of the reportnotethat while the early data show disproportionate distribution offines, its too soon to identify patterns. However, if such stories continue throughout the evaluation of this project, analysis, like this, will serve to guide the standard in just and effective public policy, they wrote."

In a letter to his fans, the rock legend explained that he had recently applied to become a dual citizen and passed the test for American citizenship, answering honestly to each question. But, Young wrote Friday, he was asked to take another test due to my use of marijuana and how some people who smoke it have exhibited a problem. Young said that problem stems from an April 19 clarification to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services policy that lists the use of marijuana, among other federally controlled substances, as a conditional bar to establishing good moral character. AD Good moral character, or GMC, is a general requirement for U.S. citizenship introduced in 1970 that gauges whether an applicant measures up to the standards of average citizens of the community in which the applicant resides. Even though a number of U.S. states have decriminalized marijuana use for both medicinal and nonmedicinal purposes, the drug remains a controlled substance at the federal level. AD Neil Young takes aim not just at Trump, but Monsanto and Starbucks, too Young, who turns 74 on Tuesday, specifically cited former attorney general Jeff Sessions in his letter, who in 2018 made it easier for U.S. prosecutors to enforce federal marijuana law in states that had legalized the substance. It came as a reversal to an Obama-era policy that discouraged enforcement of the law in states where it was legal. The USCIS says U.S. citizenship applicants involved in certain marijuana related activities may lack GMC if found to have violated federal law, even if such activity is not unlawful under applicable states and foreign laws. AD In a statement, a USCIS spokesperson said the agency could not discuss, confirm or deny information about Youngs case due to privacy protections. The spokesperson reiterated that marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance. AD The District of Columbia and 11 states Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington have adopted laws allowing recreational use of the drug. I sincerely hope I have exhibited good moral character and will be able to vote my conscience on Donald J. Trump and his fellow American candidates, (as yet unnamed), Young wrote on his website. I will keep you posted, but I dont think I will be able to remain parked here during the proceedings. AD In an interview with the Los Angeles Times last month, Young said even though he moved to California in the mid-1960s, the countrys climate crisis is a prevailing reason he wants to become a U.S. citizen now. A known liberal and environmentalist, Young in 2015 asked Trump not to use his song Rockin in the Free World at campaign events. AD Weve got a climate emergency and governments are not acting. Democracy is based on [the principle that] you have a vote, you have a voice, he told the Times . Im still a Canadian. Theres nothing that can take that away from me. But I live down here. I pay taxes down here. My beautiful family is down here. Theyre all Americans. So I want to register my opinion."

Dream Day, we ask our favorite people in the area to tell us how they would spend a perfect day in the District. If D.C. had a Queen of Cannabis, the throne might belong to Brooklands Caroline Phillips, the founder of the National Cannabis Festival . Phillips, a native Washingtonian who runs events company The High Street, started the festival in 2016, after D.C. voters legalized marijuana for recreational use (but not sales). This years festival appropriately falls on April 20 and features music from Ludacris and Action Bronson (RFK Festival Grounds; Sat., noon-8 p.m., $55). Because this is D.C., the festival will also host a policy summit Friday at The Newseum. Its great to see the D.C. area become a destination for people interested in cannabis recreationally but also cannabis policy, says Phillips, 38. Recreational marijuana sales would officially be legal on her dream day, and, since the festival itself was once just a pipe dream, her itinerary would lead there. I would meet up with Brau Runners thats my running team. We do a lot of Ragnar relays along with charity races. We always start at a bar and end at a bar, so wed start at Brooklands Finest . Our run would take us down Rhode Island Avenue NE. Theres a pretty gnarly hill there, but once you get to the top, you feel really good about yourself. Wed hang right on Florida Avenue NW and stop and idle in front of the MetroPCS store to soak in some D.C. go-go music. AD AD We would head back to Brooklands Finest, my favorite place for brunch. They always have a special waffle that has some kind of fruit compote and whipped cream. You cant really go wrong with that. Im going to hop back to my house and grab my dogs two little mutts and significant other. We would go by one of D.C.s dispensaries and pick something up for the day that could be used in a vape pen. Id like to stop by Union Market . First I would stop at DC Dosa . Usually I just point to things I dont have a thing I normally get there. Then I would go to Trickling Springs Creamery for a milkshake. Were walking and as we round a turn, I [spot] the whole National Cannabis Festival team. We all end up walking together down H Street NE. AD I like Congressional Cemetery for a good dog walk. Theres this bench on top of the hill. Underneath it theres this little compartment and theres a notebook inside. Everybody can open it up and leave a message. Whenever I go there, I sit down for a bit and just read through the different stories. Im pretty sure I left a note in there around 2015 when I started thinking about the festival. AD Were heading over to the festival grounds. Everything is just happening: Wonderful festival fairies are dropping everything into position. To get there, were going to pass the D.C. Central Detention Facility . This is a weird part of my dream day, but I do think its important for people to understand that there are people in jail for trying to pay their bills with weed, while there are now states that are paying their bills with weed money. I would take a moment to really think about the people who have been jailed for drug offenses. At the festival, the first stop is the advocacy village. Wed probably fan out from there and, finally, all gather together in front of the stage for Ludacris."
