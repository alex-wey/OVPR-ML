(Nikki Kahn/THE WASHINGTON POST) Even more surprised? Mainstream marijuana activists, many of whom have never heard of the organization or its founder, Tom Leto. The major lobbying and advocacy groups have so far held off on endorsing a presidential candidate they say Obama hasnt lived up to a vow to back off raids. Our whole community was asking who is this clown? says Aaron Houston, executive director of the Students for Sensible Drug Policy . And conspiracy theories, unsurprisingly, bloomed. The U.S. Medical Marijuana Chamber of Commerces press release endorsing Obama claimed it has 10,000 members in chapters across the country, and its Web site lists a box-office address on a swank stretch of Pennsylvania Ave. The group does not appear to be incorporated, nor is it listed in nonprofit records or in Dun & Bradstreet.

Shapiro referred our questions to his office, but the person we spoke to there said she wasnt authorized to speak on the record. Still, pot advocates are wary. Paranoid, even. But then again...
