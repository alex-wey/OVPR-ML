If passed, Proposition 19 would control marijuana like alcohol, allowing adults 21 years of age and over to possess up to an ounce of pot for personal consumption and grow marijuana at a private residence in a space of up to 25 square feet. The initiative would also allow local governments to tax and regulate the commercial cultivation, transport, and sale of marijuana. In order to get a handle on the debate surrounding. Prop 19, we spoke to both supporters and opponents of the initiative. So what do you think? Should Californians legalize marijuana?"

This is despite repeated claims from President Obama and his Department of Justice that they would not devote federal resources to circumventing state medical marijuana laws. ""The law has been hijacked by profiteers who are motivated not by compassion, but by money,"" said Melinda Haag, one of California's U.S. Attorneys, at a DOJ press conference on October 11, 2011. Aaron Sandusky, owner of G3 Holistic , a group of medical marijuana dispensaries in California's Inland Empire, is one such target of the DOJ's crackdown on medical marijuana ""profiteers."" The DOJ sent him a letter promising to shut down his operations within 14 days. And they followed through. Reason.tv talked to Sandusky, who's long battled the city of Upland's sordid handling of medical marijuana dispensaries, before and after he was raided. ""We all want the same thing,"" said Sandusky. ""We want to see less crime. That's why we have these places."" Sgt. Glenn Walsh and Agent Mark Brewster, both members of the California Narcotic Officer's Association , believe that the stepped up enforcement from the DOJ is a positive development. ""There's no avenue in the law, whatsoever, to accommodate the sales of marijuana,"" Brewster said. Walsh concurs, arguing that California's Prop 215 and SB 420 allow for the collective cultivation of medical marijuana but do not allow for a single cent to exchange hands during that process. ""If it's my land, and I want to help you cultivate marijuana [on it], I can do that,"" said Walsh. ""You cannot, however, reimburse me for any expenses."" The prospect of cultivating and distributing a legal product to a large demand base without any money changing hands seems far-fetched to medical marijuana growers and sellers like Sandusky, who himself invested hundreds of thousands of dollars and years of his life in a grower's facility before it was raided and destroyed in early November. ""They seized all of our assets, all of my personal assets,"" said Sandusky. ""I have sixty dollars in my pocket. That's it."" The DOJ has issued threatening letters to dozens of dispensaries across the state and plans to continue shutting them down one by one. While some in the government work to shield Obama from criticism on the issue, the President has so far remained curiously silent on the crackdowns."

He had some of the best doctors in the world, he was on a transplant list and he had completed a successful clinical trial that had his doctors dubbing him a ""miracle man."" Then, his cancer returned and two months before he was would have received a transplant, he was de-listed for smoking marijuana prescribed by his oncologist at Cedars-Sinai. Now, if he doesn't receive a transplant, he will die. ""It's only my life that I'm fighting for,"" says Smith. ""What do I have to hide? I have nothing to hide."" Smith's situation represents one of the first battles being fought over the place of medical marijuana in medicine and it has left him in limbo. Cedars-Sinai declined interview requests but referred Reason TV to Peggy Stewart, a clinical social worker with UCLA's transplant program, which holds a similar position to Cedars-Sinai on medical marijuana. ""Marijuana is considered substance abuse,"" says Stewart. ""The legality of it is really not an issue."" Stewart and Cedars-Sinai did say that transplant patients who consume marijuana put themselves at potential risk of infection from a mold found in cannabis called aspergillus. But not everyone sees the mold as a potential threat. ""The truth is that Norman lives in Los Angeles and there are laboratories that he can take his medicine to and make sure that it doesn't have contaminants,"" says Stephanie Sherer of Americans for Safe Access , which works to break down political and legal barriers to medical cannabis. Further, a 2009 study from the American Journal on Transplantation that looked at potential liver transplant candidates said that there wasn't a significant difference between marijuana users from marijuana non-users. Sherer points out that Smith isn't alone, his problems are the reality for many patients caught in-between managing their pain and receiving a transplant. ""In our database at our office, we know of over two dozen patients that are going through this and unfortunately half of them have passed away because they did not receive these transplants,"" says Smith."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/05/29/Pot-Shops-doomed-in-LA,breitbart.com,Pot Shops Doomed in Los Angeles?,William Bigelow,05-29-2012,,"The Los Angeles City Council is considering two options for eliminating marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles. PLUM, the L.A. City Council's Planning and Land Use Management, has a gentle ban approach before it as well as a more hard-line approach. The gentle ban that was offered by City Councilman Paul Koretz has language that is designed to palliate the sensitivities of the pot-smoking crowd: ... more reasonable approach to compliance could include a limited immunity approach whereby the City proceeds forward with a ban on dispensaries but uses its prosecutorial discretion to abstain from any enforcement action against the limited number of dispensaries that do not violate a set of City Council imposed restrictions. This approach would protect neighborhoods while still assuring limited safe access for patients within the confines of ever evolving case law. It is unclear what protect neighborhoods means; does Koretz mean that by allowing dispensaries that follow the Councils guidelines, the neighborhoods wont riot? The second proposal under consideration is more severe: to ban all dispensaries until a case before the California Supreme Court, Pack v. City of Long Beach , is decided. The case revolves around Long Beachs attempt to regulate its marijuana dispensaries the same way Los Angeles does. Proponents of medical marijuana are prepared to show up en masse to protest the proposals."
http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/01/Judicial-Watch-Brief-Challenges-Constitutionality-of-AZ-Medical-Marijuana-Act,breitbart.com,Judicial Watch Brief Challenges Legality of AZ Medical Marijuana Act,Tom Fitton,04-01-2013,,"Imagine this scenario: voters in the State of California, after a furious special interest propaganda campaign, elect to flout federal law and render it legal in the state for printers to manufacture their own counterfeit currency. Maybe they were convinced this was necessary to fix the states economic woes. Or maybe they were told public officials would use the currency in place of taxpayer funds to bankroll important public projects. The reason doesnt really matter. The key question is this: would you support the right of California to enact such a provision? My guess is not a chance. However, a very similar ridiculous scenario is playing out right now in the State of Arizona, where a new state law permits the distribution of marijuana for medical purposes. And Judicial Watch has stepped into the battle. Judicial Watch filed an amicus curiae brief in the Court of Appeals of the State of Arizona, District One, in support of Maricopa County and the State of Arizonas lawsuit appealing a December, 4, 2012, Maricopa Superior Court ruling that the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (AMMA) did not conflict with federal drug laws. In its brief, Judicial Watch maintains that the AMMA, which permits the use of marijuana for medical purposes, is a direct violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which makes it unlawful to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense any controlled substance: Federal law is unambiguous in that marijuana is a controlled substance regulated under a comprehensive statutory and regulatory scheme. As such, the production, sale, and use of marijuana, other than as part of a federally authorized research program, is a violation of federal law regardless of any state law permitting such activities even in a limited manner. Further, the Superior Court ruling notwithstanding, the CSA preempts the AMMA under the Supremacy Clause, which makes federal laws supreme, contrary to any state law. Citing the CSA provisions, Judicial Watch maintains: ...where a positive conflict exists between the CSA and a state law such that the two cannot consistently stand together, the CSA shall be construed as evidencing Congressional intent to occupy the field in which the CSA provision operates . And how did this wind up in the courts? In 2010, Arizona voters narrowly approved a ballot measure allowing people with certain debilitating medical conditions to use medical marijuana. Under the law, state health officials can license up to 126 dispensaries in designated areas. In June, 2012, the White Mountain Health Center sued Maricopa County for allegedly stalling approval of its zoning application to prevent it from seeking a state operating license for a dispensary. In December 2004, the Maricopa Superior Court ruled in White Mountains favor. In its amicus brief defending the Maricopa County appeal, Judicial Watch argues: Maricopa County cannot issue a zoning permit for a facility for the cultivation and dispensing of marijuana any more than it could issue a permit to establish a meth lab or a print shop for counterfeit currency. Our federal system does not permit that. This is a clear cut case where federal law trumps state law, regardless of how many voters may wish it werent so. Medical marijuana special interest groups have invested heavily in shaping public perception on this issue, but we cannot allow the rule of law to be subject to the shifting whims of the electorate. If marijuana is to be legalized, the U.S. Constitution requires that it be done by an act of Congress. In the meantime, a state simply cant legalize something that is a felony under federal law. Conflicting marijuana laws create not just uncertainty in the law, but undermine the rule of law that protects our liberty."
http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/02/24/study-fatal-car-crashes-by-marijuana-smokers-up-300-over-last-decade/,breitbart.com,Study: Fatal Car Crashes by Marijuana Smokers up 300% over Last Decade,Robert Wilde,02-24-2014,,"Fatal Crashes involving marijuana use tripled during the previous decade, according to researchers from Columbia Universitys Mailman School of Public Health. The pot related accidents have helped fuel the overall increase in drugged-driving traffic deaths. As widespread acceptance of marijuana becomes the norm in the U.S., demonstrated by recent legalization laws in Colorado and Washington , many experts fear a continuing upward spiral of marijuana related traffic injuries and deaths. Currently, one of nine drivers involved in fatal crashes would test positive for marijuana, said co-author Dr. Guohua Li, director of the Center for Injury Epidemiology and Prevention at Columbia. If this trend continues, in five or six years non-alcohol drugs will overtake alcohol to become the most common substance involved in deaths related to impaired driving. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER The study draws its conclusions from statistics on more than 23,500 drivers who died within one hour of a crash between 1999 and 2010. The toxicology tests were performed on victims from six states including: California, Hawaii, Illinois, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and West Virginia. While alcohol related traffic fatalities remained steady at 40% throughout the decade, drug related deaths soared from 16% in 1999 to a whopping 28% in 2010. Significantly, the study cites marijuana use as the leading culprit for the swelling number of drug related traffic deaths, contributing to 12 percent of 2010 crashes. This represents a 300% increase compared with four percent in 1999. The study qualifies the pot statistics by emphasizing that because marijuana stays in the blood for up to one week, therefore, researchers said, the prevalence of nonalcohol drugs reported in this study should be interpreted as an indicator of drug use, not necessarily a measurement of drug impairment. Not surprisingly, experts warned that combining alcohol and marijuana dramatically increases a drivers risk of death. If a driver is under the influence of alcohol, their risk of a fatal crash is 13 times higher than the risk of the driver who is not under the influence of alcohol, Li said. But if the driver is under the influence of both alcohol and marijuana, their risk increases to 24 times that of a sober person. The increase in marijuana use is not limited to any one segment of the population and is prevalent in both sexes and across all age groups, according to the online Jan. 29 American Journal of Epidemiology . The study reveals that pot impairs users similarly to the way alcohol does. Deputy executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, Jonathan Adkins, contends that it impairs judgment, affects vision, and affects the ability to use good judgment. Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) national president Jan Withers asserts that: This study shows an alarming increase in driving under the influence of drugs and, in particular, it shows an increase in driving under the influence of both alcohol and drugs. When it comes to drugged driving versus drunk driving, the substances may be different but the consequences are the same needless deaths and injuries. Adkins says the study is a wake-up call for highway police: The legalization of pot is going to spread to other states. Its not even a partisan issue at this point. Our expectation is this will become the norm rather than the rarity. Co-author Li says that officials are working on improving marijuana testing devices to measure pot use when drivers are stopped by police, I would say in maybe five years or more you will see some testing method or technique that may not be as accurate as the breathalyzer, but is more accurate than the testing devices we have today."

I think it was some of the genius of the framers, is understanding that we have many different states, and the citizens of each state are going to have different values. And so as you know, Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis referred to federalism and the many states as laboratories of democracy. He continued, when it comes to a question of legalizing marijuana, I dont support legalizing marijuana. If it were on the ballot in the state of Texas, I would vote no. But I also believe thats a legitimate question for the states to make a determination. And the citizens of Colorado and Washington State have come to a different conclusion. They have decided they want to legalize it. I think it is appropriate for the federal government to recognize that the citizens of those states have made that decision, and one of the benefits of it, you know, using Brandeis terms of laboratories of democracy, is we can now watch and see what happens in Colorado and Washington State. There have been lots of theoretical arguments for a long time about the consequences of legalizing marijuana. We can now see. If those states suddenly see a dramatic increase in teen drug use, if they see a dramatic increase in crime, if they see significant harmful effects coming from it, I suspect other states are going to be far less eager to walk down that road."

The Jewish state has already established itself as a pioneer in high-tech and cutting-edge agriculture, and more and more U.S. firms are now realizing that the countrys expertise has extended to the booming medical marijuana industry, expected to grow to $23 billion in the U.S. by 2020. According to Saul Kaye, CEO of iCAN, a private cannabis research hub, American companies have invested about $50 million over the past couple of years in licensing Israeli medical marijuana patents, cannabis agro-tech startups, and companies developing delivery devices such as inhalers. I expect it to grow to $100 million in the coming year, Kaye said at iCANs CannaTech conference in Tel Aviv this month, a largegathering of medical marijuana experts. In the United States, cannabis R&D is restricted by draconian regulations setby the Drug Enforcement Administration. Even though use of the drug for medical purposes is permitted in 23 U.S. states, and its recreational use is allowed in anotherfour, marijuana is still classified at the federal level as a dangerous narcotic with no medicinal value. In the United States, its easier to study heroin than marijuana, said U.S. psychiatrist Suzanne Sisley, Director of Medicinal Plant Research at Heliospectra. With marijuana you have to go through added layers of government red tape. It highlights the way marijuana research is being shackled by politics, said Sisley, who has led research intothe effects of cannabis as a treatment for American military veterans suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Jeffrey Friedland, CEO of private U.S. investment firm Friedland Global Capital, has invested in two agro-tech companies and a pharmaceutical firm in Israel. Israel is a leader in agriculture, take that and couple it with research you have the two sides, plant science and pharmaceutical development, Friedland said. If youre in California or Colorado, youre getting medical marijuana in a lot of cases from someone who did not graduate high-school theres no science. In Israel, recreational use of the drug is still illegal. Only 23,000 people have Health Ministry permits to purchase medical cannabis from nine licensed suppliers. However, Israeli authorities are far more relaxed when it comes to research of the drug. Growers work in tandem with scientific institutions to develop cannabis strains that treat a range of illnesses. Israeli Health Minister Yakov Litzman, an ultra-Orthodox Jew, supports the usage of medical cannabis and has introduced measures to ease procurement of prescriptions. In a clinic in Tel Aviv, 65-year-old Noa lights a joint. She suffers from fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder, and explains how six months of smoking medical cannabis has transformed her life. I can function again. Most importantly, Im a grandma, I can roll around on the floor with the kids, she told Reuters . The clinic belongs to Tikun Olam, Israels largest medical marijuana supplier, which partnered with a private U.S. investment group earlier in the year to grow medical marijuana in four U.S. states. Tikun Olam is also taking part in clinical trials on epilepsy, Crohns disease, spasticity, and tinnitus, said Zvi Bentowich, its chief scientist. Professor Raphael Mechoulam of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem praised the Israeli governments liberal attitude toward the research. Cannabinoid research was and still is viewed positively by government committees, he said, adding that law enforcement was not involved in study approval. Professor Mechoulam is creditedwith discovering THC, marijuanas main psychoactive ingredient, in the 1960s. American investors are also claiming that you get more bang for your buck in Israel. What you would spend half a million dollars on in the U.S. you could easily get for $125-150,000in Israel and its going to be done efficiently and on time. The quality of research is world-class and the arbitrage of value is good, said Seth Yakatan, CEO of California-based Kalytera Therapeutics."

Jeff Sessions’ Nomination for Attorney General Job,Warner Todd Huston,01-04-2017,,"An advocacy group for pot is urging Senators to reject the nomination of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions to serve the next U.S. Attorney General. The group, DCMJ.org , led the successful campaign in 2016 to legalize marijuana in the District of Columbia and is now targeting Sessions who they say is not friendly to legal marijuana. We have come to assume Senator Sessions will overturn the will of more than 70% of the voters in the District of Columbia that voted for full legalization if made Attorney General, according to a letter sent to legislators in Congress by DCMJ co-founders Adam Eidinger and Nikolas Schiller. He will be empowered to ignore the 60% of Americans who support legal cannabis or the more than 80% of U.S. citizens, who support legalizing cannabis for medical purposes. DCMJ insists that legalizing pot has proven to be a jobs creator and reversing the recent gains for legalization will impact the economies of several states. Further, they say, overturning any of the pro-pot statutes across the country disproportionately impacts minorities and alsohurts critically ill patients who use cannabis for pain relief. Claiming that the vast majority of Americans agree with legalizing pot, the group charges that Sessions has ideas that are harmful, racially biased, costly, outdated, ineffective, and counterintuitive to economic growth and the nations homeland security efforts. We will use all practical means to fight the threat Sessions poses to overturn the will of the voters, ignore science and medical professionals and put black market marijuana back in the hands of international organized crime rings, Eidinger said in a press release. During a recent Senate panel on the public impact of changing marijuana laws across the country, Sessions noted that marijuana is very dangerous, and said the country will regret legalizing the drug. Sessions added: We need grown-ups in charge in Washington saying marijuana is not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized, it ought to be minimized, that it is in fact a very real danger. You can see the accidents, traffic deaths related to marijuana. And youll see cocaine and heroin increase more than it would have, I think. DCMJ plans a protest for Trumps oath of office ceremony on January 20. The group plans to parade toward the National Mall handing out 4,200 joints of legally grown cannabis along the way. They intend to all light up among the inauguration crowd at 4 minutes and 20 seconds into President Trumps speech. They say they will cancel their protest only if Donald Trump comes out in support of their cause."

On Thursday, Compassionate Cultivation will begin administering lab-tested cannabidiol (CBD) extract oil to approved patients withintractable epilepsy (IE), a condition that affects one-third of all people with epilepsy. While prescription drugs do not work well to alleviate their seizures, low doses ofcannabis oil show great promise. Our company is dedicated to reducing the suffering of qualifying patients in the Lone Star State, and we are thrilled to offer the highest-quality medical cannabis products, with plants grown and refined by our cultivation and engineering experts at our state-of-the-art facility, said Morris Denton, CEO for Compassionate Cultivation, in a press release. The company is located in the Austin area and offers delivery service to approved patientsstatewide. The dispensarys manager Cullen Vujosevic commented, in other states, theres no medical provider interaction woven into the medical cannabis program, but in Texas, the Compassionate Use Act is heavily integrated with the healthcare providers who closely interact with patients. That allows physicians to provide patients with a much higher level of medical care. In 2015, Breitbart Texas reported the state legalized the use of CBD oil for IE patients through the Compassionate Use Act,Senate Bill 339. Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed this legislation into law, noting that IE affects roughly 150,000 Texans, including many children. However, he made clear thatthe medicinal use ofcannabidiol to treat IE did not open the door to broader marijuana legislation. The CBD oil that helps curb seizures is made from non-euphoric marijuana extract. Technicians remove from the plant THC (Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol), the compound in marijuana that producesthe sensation offeeling high. Theresulting cannabidiol is also known as high-CBD, low-THC oil. This form of medical marijuana is only available to state-registered patients or their guardians. SB 339 requires that prescribing physicians are certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. They must also dedicate a significant portion of their medical practices to the evaluation and treatment of epilepsy, hold certain board certifications in epilepsy, neurology, neurology with special qualification in child neurology, or neurophysiology, and comply with registration requirements under the Compassionate Use Act. A patient must be a permanent resident of Texas and receiveapproval for CBD oil from two of the 18 physicians certified with the Compassionate Use Registry of Texas (CURT) program, although only one of these doctors needs to treat the patient. Compassionate Cultivation officials say they have worked closely with Texas lawmakers, patients, and advocacy groups, including the Texas Epilepsy Foundation, to ensure patients can safely and legally access high-quality cannabis oil products under the Compassionate Use Act.This medicalmarijuana company isone of three currently licensed with the Texas Department of Public Safety. Another is Cansortium Texas, part of Florida-based Consortium Holdings. It operates in Texas as Knox Medical and was the first provider to receive its medical marijuana license in the state. Reportedly, theydelivered thefirst legal CBD oil to aTexas youngster last week. Surterra Texas,the third dispensary, is part of a Florida wellness company that already produces low-THC medical marijuana. They plan to open a grow site and processing facility in the Austin area, according to the Austin Business Journal. The National Conference of State Legislatures lists Texas as one of 17 states thatpermits the limited use of CBD oilfor certain medical reasons."

The drugs were found in the same plant that was recently visited by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO). The discovery took place this week in Cadereyta when Federal Police officers found 45 marijuana plants hidden within the brushy back area of the facility. Cadereyta is approximately 110 miles south from the border city of Reynosa. The refinery is run by controversial state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex). Information provided to Breitbart News by law enforcement sources revealed the plants were initially found by Pemex security guards who contacted federal authorities. The rear part of the facility is federally restricted but rarely supervised, law enforcement sources revealed. In May, AMLO and Nuevo Leon Governor Jaime Rodriguez Calderon visited the refinery to oversee a series of repairs. It remains unclear how federal authorities who oversee AMLOs security missed the grow operation."
