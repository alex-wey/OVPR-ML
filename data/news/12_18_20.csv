While a small number of patients already receiving marijuana will continue to do so, new applicants will be encouraged to try synthetic forms of delta-9-THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, rather than the weed itself, according to a new policy directive due to be signed by James O. Mason, chief of the Public Health Service. Mason said yesterday he was concerned about a surge in new applications in recent months, especially from AIDS patients, and the message it would send if HHS were to approve them. ""If it's perceived that the Public Health Service is going around giving marijuana to folks, there would be a perception that this stuff can't be so bad,"" said Mason. ""It gives a bad signal. I don't mind doing that if there's no other way of helping these people. . . . But there's not a shred of evidence that smoking marijuana assists a person with AIDS."" But his decision drew angry criticism from pro-marijuana activists who contended that many AIDS and cancer patients have found the drug invaluable in combating the nausea caused by their treatments. ""This is ludicrous,"" said Kevin Zeese, vice president of the Drug Policy Foundation, a group that has promoted the use of marijuana for medical purposes. ""What they are going to do is deny medicine to very sick Americans for political reasons. . . . This shows the cruelty of the war on drugs."" Zeese noted that Herbert D. Kleber, deputy national drug control policy director, had touted the program on national television as a ""compassionate"" option that was available to seriously ill patients. But while the new HHS policy has been in the works for more than two months, officials said this week they did not believe the drug control policy office had been consulted. Kleber was out of town yesterday and could not be reached for comment. The new policy is the latest development in a debate about marijuana's classification under the drug laws. The Drug Enforcement Administration has denied that marijuana has any therapeutic value and has classified it as a Schedule I drug, the same as heroin, forbidding doctors to prescribe it. But last April, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ordered the DEA to reconsider its stand after concluding that the agency had acted unreasonably in evaluating the drug's possible effectiveness. In addition, a recent survey by Harvard University researchers found that nearly half of 1,035 cancer specialists who responded reported that they would prescribe marijuana to their patients if it were legal to do so. For the past 15 years, pre-rolled cigarettes of marijuana -- grown at a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) research farm in Oxford, Miss. -- have been provided to a handful of such patients. But officials said applications began to increase markedly following publicity over the case of Kenneth and Barbra Jenks, a Florida couple suffering from AIDS. Convicted of violating the state's drug laws last year, the Jenkses applied and won Food and Drug Administration approval to use the drug as an ""investigative new drug."" While only six people had received marijuana under the program before last summer, the FDA has received 28 applications in the past year, and was concerned that it would be swamped with hundreds more in coming months, officials said. Pro-marijuana activists ""were beginning to promote this . . . it was becoming a kind of 'write in and here's how you do it' kind of thing,"" said Jeffrey A. Nesbit, an FDA spokesman."

Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. yesterday became the nation's first Republican governor to sign into law a measure that relaxes criminal punishment for seriously ill people who use marijuana to relieve pain and other symptoms. Ehrlich also approved a bill to reorganize the state's largest health insurer, partly in response to a failed effort by the company to convert into a for-profit firm and enrich its executives. In signing those two bills, along with a measure that moves Maryland closer to giving illegal immigrants the right to obtain driver's licenses, Ehrlich showed an independence that reflected his campaign to portray himself as a moderate Republican bent on reforming state government. A day earlier, by contrast, he displayed a conservative, pro-business face by vetoing a $135 million package of corporate tax increases as well as bills that would have lowered college tuition for illegal immigrants and required Home Depot and other retailers to sell more energy-efficient appliances. As he made some of the biggest policy decisions of his first year in office, Ehrlich crossed swords with politicians from liberals to Bush administration officials. On other issues, he won praise from the same groups, reinforcing his record as a lawmaker who is careful not to stray too far from the center. ""These are not easy issues, not easy bills,"" Ehrlich said of the measures he has signed and vetoed over the past two days. Taken together, he said, his decisions reflect an administration committed to bipartisan governance and ""balanced with a unique dash of independence."" He was particularly firm in his support for the marijuana measure. It does not legalize the drug but provides that seriously ill people caught using marijuana for medical purposes cannot be jailed or be fined more than $100. The White House and some conservative supporters urged the governor to reject the bill, but Ehrlich cited his longtime support for the measure. ""If you look at my views over the years, there are clearly two wings of the party on social issues,"" he said. ""One is more conservative, and one is more libertarian. I belong to the latter, and I always have."" The bill reorganizing CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield also sparked a heated debate. Company executives and health care lobbyists had prodded Ehrlich to reject the measure, but analysts said that would have hurt the governor politically. ""He really didn't have any choice,"" said Matthew Crenson, a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University. ""If he had vetoed that, it would have given the Democrats a club to beat him over the head with."" The bill, which gives the state more control over the insurance company by replacing almost half the board of directors and requiring that it remain a nonprofit for at least five years, prompted an immediate lawsuit from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association seeking to sever its affiliation with the company. The Maryland attorney general also filed suit to block such a move. Some Democrats were quick to seize on several of Ehrlich's vetoes as political ammunition, calling him a ""hard-right"" Republican. But others said it wasn't so easy to pin a political label on the governor. ""On policy, Governor Ehrlich has been pretty progressive,"" said House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel). ""He's pro-choice. He's open on a lot of issues. On fiscal issues, he's pretty moderate."" But Busch said Ehrlich caved in to pressure from his conservative base by vetoing the tax bill, a plan he had negotiated with legislative leaders, after 42 of 43 House Republicans voted against the package. ""It was the first indication that the party was going to drive him to the right,"" Busch said. For the most part, Ehrlich's decisions this week were consistent with promises he made on the campaign trail last year, his voting record as a legislator and his public statements since he was sworn in four months ago. After lawmakers killed his proposal to legalize slot machine gambling in March, Ehrlich vowed to retaliate by rejecting higher taxes on corporations and other fees. Democrats passed a tax bill anyway, prompting his veto. ""A lot of this is pure politics, political drama at the highest levels,"" said Donald F. Norris, a professor of policy sciences at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. ""It seems to me that he's drawing a line in the sand, that he's telling legislators, 'I told you what I was going to do, you didn't believe me, and I went ahead and did it.' "" Although he had declined for weeks to say whether he would sign the medical marijuana bill, Ehrlich had supported such measures in principle during his eight years in Congress and during last year's gubernatorial race. ""I don't agree with him on that philosophy, but I wasn't surprised,"" said Senate Minority Leader J. Lowell Stolzfus (R-Somerset), who argued vehemently against the bill. ""The Republican Party is maturing. Most people on the conservative side realize we're not getting everything we want, but we're satisfied."" Critics did point out some inconsistencies in Ehrlich's decisions. Although Ehrlich in recent weeks has vowed to cut $1 billion in spending next year to avoid tax increases, he allowed a 5-cent increase in the state property tax rate. And while Ehrlich has argued that Maryland has spent beyond its means in recent years, the governor picked up the budget ax only after lawmakers rejected his proposal to legalize slot machines, which would have generated $800 million a year in new funds for the state treasury. ""We can do better. The governor can do better,"" said Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Prince George's). ""Thus far, his actions are wrong and off base."" Some Democrats were already preparing a campaign to reverse some of Ehrlich's vetoes. Montgomery County Executive Douglas M. Duncan (D) wrote letters to Miller and Busch yesterday, asking them to override the governor's rejection of a bill that would have allowed county leaders to raise vehicle registration fees to generate money for transportation projects. Republicans, too, were not pleased with all of the governor's decisions. Baltimore County GOP Chairman Donald Murphy said party activists in Ehrlich's home county are ""very much opposed"" to proposals to assist illegal immigrants, including a bill the governor signed that creates a commission to explore whether the state should allow illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses. ""We're not even two years from 9/11,"" Murphy said, ""and this bill would make it easier for illegal immigrants to get valid identification."" But other GOP leaders said few in the party had soured on the party's first governor in Maryland since Spiro T. Agnew resigned 34 years ago. John Kane, chairman of the Maryland Republican Party, said Ehrlich's actions underscored his appeal to Democrats and Republicans alike. ""You have to govern from the center and govern for all Marylanders,"" Kane said, ""and I think this governor knows that."" Staff writers Matthew Mosk and Jo Becker contributed to this report. Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. prepares to sign into law bills on medical use of marijuana, CareFirst and the Maryland pension board."

Garrigus, 33, went through a rehab program as he battled substance abuse issues early in his career. As a player the Nationwide Tour, the PGAs developmental circuit, he and other golfers would sneak off to smoke often in portable toilets. Oh, yeah, there were plenty of guys on the Nationwide Tour who smoked in the middle of the round, Garrigus told Golf Digest . We always talked about it. You could go in the Porta John and take your drags. Garrigus said his drug use was limited and began during college at Arizona. The PGA began drug testing in 2008. It was all golf and partying, he said. I never did hard drugs. I never did coke or LSD. It was just smoking and drinking and hanging out with friends. The smoking got to be habitual: five, 10, maybe 20 times a day. I didn't keep track of how much. I constantly needed to be high. And I took it to the max. Every single day. Mostly just smoking, smoking, smoking."

In his column, Fine states five common-sensical assertions regarding marijuana use in our country that he wishes werent true, labels them as myths, and presto, concludes that legalizing weed will actually help solve a lot of problems. Oh, really? Call me old-fashioned, but also call me realistic. Advocates of legalizing marijuana are making this debate harder than it has to be. Simply put: What current problems of ours might be solved if we had more inebriated people wandering among us? The first thing pot promoters want us to do is deny the obvious, as if we are all stoned. They want us to believe that the known consequences associated with being on the loose with degraded senses in an open society would simply not occur or at the very least, would not increase if marijuana use were to become more widespread. In Fines case, myth number one is that, If pot is legal, more people will use it. To rebut that statement, Fine cites something or another about drug use in Portugal between the years 2002 and 2006. Im not kidding, this is the best theyve got. I dont know what it is about modern life in Portugal that we should seek to emulate or why Portuguese drug use should serve as a model for drug use in the United States. But, you get my point. Read Fines piece. Anyway, this is an issue where Republicans should be clear and speak with one voice. At a base level, our politics should seek to promote a more sober, safe and virtuous society, and nothing about making pot use more widespread than it already is serves the common interest. I can hear the left rolling their eyes at this quaint notion. We should not think we can appeal to a segment of voters particularly young voters by embracing destructive misbehavior as desirable public policy."

Two months ago, Oklahoma and Nebraska filed a complaint with the Supreme Court, arguingthat Colorados regulations violate the U.S. Constitution. Now, Safe Streets Alliance, an anti-crime group led by a Reagan-administration veteran, is bringing forward two moresuits in federal court. Safe Streets Chairman James Wootton, who according to his Web sitebiography served in in the Reagan Justice Department, had already thrown his support behind the Oklahoma and Nebraska lawsuit this month. The president has both the moral andconstitutional obligation to stop this failed experiment by enforcing federal laws which prohibit the legalization of pot, he said at the time , while also unveiling a national petition to ask President Obama to do as much. The lawsuits echo that claim. In one, Safe Streets and Colorado property ownersPhillis Windy Hope Reilly andMichael P. Reilly are suing a handful ofmarijuana industry participants under federal racketeering laws and state and local officials under the charge that they are violating the constitutions supremacy clause by not enforcing federal law. The suit from Oklahoma and Nebraskasimilarly argued that latter point. In the other suit , Safe Streets joined withNew Vision Hotels Two, LLC, which owns the Holiday Inn in Frisco, Colorado to sue a handful of members of the marijuana industry on racketeering charges. New vision is suffering injuries to its business and property caused by the operations ofSummit Marijuana, a state-licensed recreational marijuana store that plans to open less than 75yards from the front entrance of New Visions hotel, they write in their suit. Legalization advocates preempted the unveiling of the Safe Streets suits on Thursday with their own planned press conference, suggesting in a statement that they have little faith the suits will succeed."

Jim McMahon, who won Super Bowl XX with the Chicago Bears, said that the plant has helped him cope with the early onset of dementia as well as severe headaches, memory loss, depression and other issues that have been linked to the kinds of concussions he suffered over the years. ""There's so many uses to this plant,"" McMahon said at last week's Cannabis World Congress and Business Expo in New York ( via the New York Daily News ). ""Hundreds of thousands of people are dying from [painkillers] and there's not one case of people dying from the hemp plant."" Related: [A Ravens lineman pushes for reform] Leonard Marshall, who has neurological issues and formerly played for the New York Giants and Jets and Washington Redskins, agreed, saying,""My quality of life has improved because of this."" Monroe's vocal advocacy comes at a time of increasing awareness of the toll of addiction to opioids and shifting attitudes about the legalization of marijuana. Recently,Jeff Miller, the NFL's senior vice president for player health and safety, and neurological surgeon Russell Lonser, a member of the league's head, neck and spine committee, spoke with researchers Monroe has backed with $80,000 in funding. ""They are interested in learning more about the potential for cannabinoids to help current and former players, as is evidenced by them taking the call, and also expressed a desire to learn more,"" Marcel Bonn-Miller, an adjunct assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania school of medicine, told XXX's Adam Kilgore recently. ""They are definitely showing genuine curiosity, and they are definitely not throwing up roadblocks."" Marijuana, however, remains on the NFL's list of banned substances. Related: [Monroe funds marijuana research] ""It's an NFL policy and we believe it's the correct policy, for now, in the best interest of our players and the long-term health of our players,"" Commissioner Roger Goodell said a Super Bowl press conference in February. ""I don't foresee a change in that clearly in the short term."" It may help save the NFL, though. Research has suggested but not yet proved that cannabis may play a role in preventing and treating concussions. Cannabidiol, or CBD, has been shown to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory as well as neuroprotective properties. Animal research indicates CBD could protect neurons and mitigate effects from concussions. Related: [Eugene Monroe released by Ravens] ""We have no guarantee this is going to work,""Lester Grinspoon, a professor emeritus at Harvard and one of the first medical marijuana researchers, toldKilgore. In fact, he says players should take it before games.""But if you can take anything away, evidence shows it is neuroprotective. I would have each individual take a capsule an hour or two before they play or practice. It's better than nothing."" To be clear, Monroe is talking aboutthe use of medical marijuana. ""I'm not here advocating for NFL players (or anyone) to get high and party while breaking the law,"" he wrote on The Players' Tribune last mont. ""What I'm talking about is the responsibility of the NFL to care for its players. Nineteen players were suspended last season for testing positive for ""substances of abuse,"" and for some, their careers may be over. Why? For using something that can actually help people? How can a league so casual about the use of addictive opioids take such a hard line on a drug that might provide a safer alternative?"" Monroe, the first active player to actively campaign for medical marijuana, is now a free agent after his release, which was fueled in part by his injury history and high salary, last week. ""Despite the current uncertainties,"" he tweeted, one thing is for sure: whatever happens in terms of my professional football career, I will never stop pushing for the League to accept medical cannabis as a viable option for pain management. I will do everything I can to ensure the generations of NFL players after me won't have to resort to harmful and addictive opioids as their only option for pain management."""

Massachusetts and California, where Napster co-founder and cancer philanthropist Sean Parker helped fund a campaign to legalize the drug, were among the states passing new recreational marijuana laws. The tide also turned in Florida, North Dakota and Arkansas where similar measures were defeated in the past and in Montana wheremeasures regarding medical marijuana were passed. Before this week, medical marijuana was legal in a little overhalf the country or 25 states. The winscome as rigorous scientific evidence ismounting that marijuana or its componentsmay have beneficial medical effects. Earlier this year,GW Pharmaceuticals said that clinical trials show acannabis-deriveddrug may be able to reduce seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome, a rare and severe form of epilepsy. Physiciansare also increasingly looking to marijuana as an alternative to highly addictiveopioids that have led toa crisis in overdoses. This chart, from my colleague Christopher Ingraham , shows just how dramatic thedifference in the painkiller prescriptions is inmedical-marijuana states vs. non-medical-marijuana states. Here's a closer look at the medical marijuana measures passed Tuesday night: Florida: A similar measure was narrowly defeated two years ago. This time, voters cast their ballots overwhelmingly in favor of a full-scale medical marijuana program. The new amendment states that patients with illnesses of the ""same kind or class as or comparable to"" serious illnesses, such as cancer, HIV, post-traumatic stress disorder, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy would be eligible to access medical marijuana. Some450,000 residents would qualify, according to The News-Press in Fort Myers. The state already had laws on the books that allowed the use of marijuana for the terminally ill and of acannabis-derived drug for epilepsy. North Dakota: According to the Bismark Tribune , ""The measure will allow people to possess up to 3 ounces of medical marijuana for treatment of up to nearly a dozen medical conditions. Facilities for medical marijuana distribution will be licensed by the state Health Department and operated by nonprofit organizations."" Montana: The Independent Record in Helena reported that the measure means that ""providers of the drug will not be limited to the number of patients they can serve:"" ""The previous restriction imposed a limit of three, which was sharply opposed by patients and providers in the program.Most medical marijuana patients were left without a registered provider under the restrictions. Since they went into effect, patients have left the program. More than a third of patients registered in September left over the next month 7,785 remained in October, according to the state health department. ""I-182 adds post-traumatic stress disorder to the list of eligible conditions, allows for lab testing for marijuana and orders annual health department inspections of providers."" Arkansas: The measure allows people who have any of18 qualifying conditions such as cancer, glaucoma, Tourette's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease and hepatitis C to access dispensaries. Accordingto the Associated Press and KTHV , ""some political leaders said they preferred that Arkansas legislators instead allow a version of the drug that is low in THC, which gives marijuana its high."""
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/11/15/only-percent-americans-say-marijuana-should-be-completely-illegal/,washingtonpost.com,Only 8 percent of Americans say marijuana should be completely illegal,Christopher Ingraham,11-15-2019,,"Most Americans - 2 out of 3 - say marijuana use should be legal, according to new data from Pew Research Center that builds on a decades-long trend line. The share of those opposed, meanwhile, has plunged 20 percentage points, to 32 percent, in the past decade. Legalization is supported by 78 percent of Democrats and 55 percent of Republicans. It has roughly two-thirds support among every racial, gender and educational group in the U.S., according to the survey. The data do show one significant demographic fault line, however: age. Legalization is supported by 63 percent of boomers, 65 percent of Gen Xers, and 76 percent of millennials. But among the silent generation those older than 74 years support is just 35 percent. AD Partisan differences are heavily mediated by age as well. Among the silent generation, for instance, there is a 32-point gap in support between Democrats (53 percent) and Republicans (21 percent). Among millennials, more than 70 percent support legal marijuana, regardless of party affiliation. AD In assessing support for marijuana, surveys have typically posed a simple question : Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal, or should NOT be made legal? For this survey, however, Pew researchers posed a separate question to suss out whether Americans back recreational marijuana, medical marijuana, both or neither. Fifty-nine percent said it should be legal for both medical and recreational purposes, a 10-point increase since fall 2016. Thirty-two percent said it should be legal for medical use only. Just 8 percent said it should not be legal at all, a steep drop from the 15 percent recorded in 2016. AD As with many political issues , the publics preferences on marijuana are well to the left of where the policy currently stands. The plant remains illegal for all purposes under federal law. Recreational marijuana is legal in 11 states plus D.C. , in most cases because of voter-approved ballot initiatives. Most other states have some form of medical marijuana law, although in many cases there are severe restrictions on the conditions for which medical marijuana can be used, or on the types of marijuana that can be used. AD According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , just four states Idaho, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas prohibit marijuana use in all forms. As more and more states have moved forward with their own marijuana liberalization policies in recent years, public support has only grown stronger, Erik Altieri, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said in a statement . At a time when the political divide is larger than ever, the issue of marijuana legalization is one of the few policy issues upon which most Americans agree. AD Legalization foes contend that marijuana use comes with negative health effects. This week, the group Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM) highlighted the results of a study in the journal JAMA Psychiatry showing a half-percentage-point increase in rates of problematic cannabis use among teens in states that have legalized recreational use. AD Legalization efforts are sending the message that marijuana use is safe and state sanctioned, SAM President Kevin Sabet said in a statement . ""No amount of marijuana use is safe for young people and more must be done to halt its normalization. Most of the Democratic presidential candidates support legalizing recreational use in some form or another . But there are notable outliers, among them former vice president Joe Biden, who long supported tough on crime legislation while he was in the U.S. Senate. He opposes legalization but has signaled a preference to reduce criminal penalties for pot use. Billionaire Democratic hopeful Mike Bloomberg recently called marijuana legalization the stupidest thing anyone has ever done. President Trump, meanwhile, has had little to say about marijuana one way or another during his time in office, though he did recently reiterate support for letting states decide their own policies."

Every part of the growing process is meticulously documented and evaluated to refine the process. After 20 years of experience, legal marijuana growers in the U.S. have a reputation for creating the best product in the world, scientifically grown and tightly regulated for quality and safety. The crop would be in high demand internationally perhaps the centerpiece of a new U.S. industry if not for the regulatory conundrum in which growers operate. AD With cannabis use an open secret in the NBA, this ex-player is pushing the league to allow CBD Because marijuana is legal in many states but still illegal federally, marijuana growers are unable to ship their products to other countries or even other American states that have legalized the drug. So while U.S. cannabis firms have driven product innovation and mastered large-scale grow operations, they restlessly wait for the export curtain to lift. AD Instead Canada has emerged as the dominant exporter in the burgeoning global marijuana trade, which ArcView Market Research and BDS Analytics estimated at $14.9 billion in sales for 2019 . Companies are raising capital and building international trade ties despite Canadas unlikely climate to be an agricultural pot haven. Canada has a huge advantage because they can fill a gap, said Rezwan Khan, vice president of global corporate development for cannabis seed supplier DNA Genetics . AD Best in the World Californias growers have been developing legal marijuana products since 1996, longer than everywhere but Amsterdam. Khan describes the state as ""the epicenter of cannabis culture."" Californias cannabis seeds have been distributed all over the world, and many foreign firms are trying to reproduce the quality of West Coast marijuana. AD The genetics and sophistication underlying the U.S. cannabis industry lead to better-quality and higher-potency flowers and innovations in oils, tinctures and edibles. The world wants that technology, said Michael Sassano, chief executive of Solaris Farms , the largest cannabis hybrid greenhouse in Nevada. The Netherlands had a big jump; they could have done anything. But the U.S. is the one that turned the industry into what it is today, with all the products we make, not Canada. AD Amazon prohibits CBD sales, but it's still easy to buy on their site The other draw of American-grown cannabis, according to Denver-based cannabis law expert Bob Hoban , is that foreign customers value the regulatory oversight that ensures the product is safe and unadulterated. Its being regulated by a government agency, which is not necessarily whats happening around the rest of the world, Hoban said. AD Hampered growth But because federal law prohibits the sale and use of marijuana, growers have not had easy access to the banking system. LivWell had to pay cash for its HVAC system, and with sales limited to in-state retailers, it has not been cost effective to invest in automation for its production line. Most processing and packaging is done by hand. AD The patchwork of legalization means cannabis is not always grown where it thrives, in warm climates with limited rainfall. Its grown where its legal. California, Oregon and Colorado grow most of the countrys authorized marijuana as legally isolated islands. That leaves cold Canada as a somewhat odd choice to be the worlds leader in marijuana exports. Only 8 percent of Americans say marijuana should be completely illegal When Canada legalized marijuana in 2018, its firms could be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. So Canadian companies represent a back door for U.S. firms to access capital and export markets, and for smaller firms, a potential exit strategy. Many U.S. marijuana growers are positioning themselves as attractive acquisition targets for Canadian firms eyeing the U.S. market. AD AD Canadian firms are using their head start to sign trade deals and secure licenses to sell marijuana internationally. While the market remains limited, at least 30 countries including Mexico, Germany and Italy have legalized medical marijuana. And the numbers are growing as scientific studies have demonstrated its utility for pain control, nausea and glaucoma. Theres more than enough time for American companies to catch up, said Kris Krane , president of 4Front Ventures, which grows and sells marijuana in nine states. But the longer that we wait, the longer we continue to maintain this unsustainable prohibition, the more difficult its going to be for American companies to catch up. Ready to export AD Changing public sentiments about marijuana in the United States have many American cannabis firms readying for the day they can legally sell their products elsewhere. AD If the state borders do break open, were preparing for that, said Sassano, who also is board chairman at Somai Pharmaceutical, a holding company based in Dublin that distributes medical cannabis products to pharmacies across Europe. That means an industry that began mainly as small mom-and-pop growers and retailers must now consider its corporate hygiene and whether its meeting legal requirements to sell in these new markets. LivWell is building large-scale indoor cannabis growing rooms in Colorado and Oregon designed to scale up production for interstate or international commerce.
