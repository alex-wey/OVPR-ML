Fleming Jr.,08-05-2009,,"It was a little after midnight when I crossed over the bridge from Laredo, Texas into the sister city of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. After having my car searched I was cleared through the Mexican Customs' check point where the military was staged and drove towards my destination. I had a source of mine, a local reporter, call me four hours earlier to tell me to meet him at a specific restaurant at 1 a.m. because he had some photographs and information I was looking for pertaining to a specific series of brutal murders that had taken place in the Laredo corridor. This wasn't all th at unusual-most of the investigative journalists in Mexico work under intense circumstances given that they often come into information relating to the drug cartels that they either can not, or will not, report on because it would be a death sentence for them, so they give the information to someone like me who will get it aired or published in way that does not connect them. I arrived early to the restaurant and since the weather was so pleasant, I decided to take a seat on the patio and have a glass of tea. I sat there for a few minutes when my source arrived and sat down, ordered a drink and handed me a large white envelope. He told me this was everything I had been asking his editor about the day before and that I should be careful how I use them. I thanked him, (by paying him) and we talked for about twenty more minutes and he asked if I could give him a ride home. He got into my rent car and told me to drive towards his house on the outskirts of town-as we drove past the airport and headed towards Monterrey, and just as I was about to make the turn off the highway to drop him near his home, we saw three sets of headlights about two hundred yards off the main road in a desolate section of land. I stopped the car and told him I wanted to see what was going on. Without objection from my friend I drove within a few yards of what appeared to be about a half dozen local cops attempting to seal off a crime scene. We exited our vehicle and walked towards the area where the police cars were shining their lights and as I looked down I was standing over three bodies that, appeared to be young boys judging by their clothes, and who were obviously dead. I stepped over to the side a few steps and there were three more lying in the bushes. As the police started talking to my reporter friend I leaned over the first three bodies and even though I'm no forensic expert, I could clearly see they had all been shot execution style in the back of the head. My friend confirmed the other three had the same type wounds. Within a few hours we were able to piece together some of the basic common threads between these young corpses. They were all teenage boys-the oldest was seventeen, the youngest was thirteen. They had all been working for one of the cartels as couriers and pocketed the money after crossing about a hundred pounds of marijuana (about $2000 worth) into the United States. They had they had been caught by their handlers (the men in charge of supervising the young gang members) and since the cartel uses hundreds of kids just like these all over Mexico and the U.S., someone made the decision to make examples of these kids. A message needed to be sent out so the rest of the young recruits would realize the severity of side dealing and not following orders. Six .40 caliber bullets to the heads of these boys sent out a very powerful message. It was a gruesome sight and it made me realize for the first time, that these kids probably never fully understood the ""consequences"" of getting involved with the cartel and dealing a little harmless weed. For years I've heard people from all over the country, many of them celebrities, politicians and businessmen make the argument that pot is harmless and that it is ""just pot"" - it's not like hard drugs and doesn't carry the same ""consequences"" as cocaine and heroin. Let me just respond like this. To the men that manufacture, transport and sell these narcotics, they are all the same thing-money, and no matter what the substance is, it is intended to be converted into money and that is entirely what this is all about for them. This is just but one example of how they will kill a thirteen year old over a load of pot just as fast as they will kill a thirty year old over a load of cocaine, heroin, or meth. The discussion about the legalization or decriminalization of certain narcotics is starting to pick up traction in our country today and I for one, embrace that discussion. That doesn't mean I embrace the legalization, but I definitely think its time to have a detailed, mature discussion on the matter. But the discussion is meaningless unless we deal with the truth and the truth is, the illicit narcotics trade is not only more profitable than ever before in the history of smuggling, but more deadly than before too. The drug policy in America has become almost schizophrenic especially as it relates to marijuana. No doubt we have to have some type comprehensive reform as it relates to the way we are prosecuting the ""war on drugs"" (dare I even say ""war on drugs?"") because what we have been doing has not worked very well by any standard. Maybe legalization is part of that solution, but this problem is far more complex than any ONE solution. Just like the fence that was built to secure our border and hasn't. What the fence did succeed in doing is curbing one problem in certain areas, but creating more problems in other areas. Neither will the legalization of narcotics fix everything wrong with the drug war. It will curb some things, but be advised it will also create new problems in areas we are not prepared for today, causing a whole new set of consequences. Unlike those teenage boys lying in the desert-we should take the time to understand and fully comprehend those consequences before we endeavor to take that next step."

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2011/06/24/doobie-brothers-ron-and-barney/,breitbart.com,'Doobie' Brothers Ron and Barney,Jeannie DeAngelis,06-24-2011,,"Kellogg’s Corn Pops may be going out of business, but Captain Zig-Zag is about to get an up-tick in popularity if political odd couple Ron Paul (R-TX) and Barney Frank (D-MA) have their way. In a bipartisan effort to end the federal ban on marijuana, a newfangled congressional edition of the “doobie” brothers are banding together to put forward legislation that limits the federal government’s role in policing pot. Ron Paul and Barney Frank are proposing the first bill ever that, if enacted into law, would end centralized marijuana prohibition. The legislation seeks to limit federal involvement in cannabis monitoring to “cross-border or inter-state smuggling.” If the proposal succeeds, marijuana farmers across America stand to save on electricity and light bulbs as recreational horticulturists venture outside to legally grow weed and even sell the fruit of their harvest in states where pot is legal. Ron Paul, individual liberty and freedom Republican/Libertarian and one half of the bill’s sponsor, said the following: “Drugs are very dangerous but there are a lot of things that are very dangerous. The question is, should we regulate danger? Should we take responsibility for ourselves or should the government take care of us? I don’t believe in the nanny state.” Paul consistently maintains that the government has no business butting into private lives, so it stands to reason that the same philosophy would apply to bong usage, whether it’s Ron Paul’s, if he has one, or someone else’s. One would expect Congressman Paul to step forward on behalf of legalizing marijuana if the end result limits government and grants individual autonomy to be either as reckless or responsible as one desires. On the other hand, Barney Frank may have other, more personal reasons for proposing the legislation. Seems Congressman Frank found himself embroiled in marijuana-related controversy when visiting longtime partner and Fire Island ferry companion James Ready at his home in Maine a few years back. James Ready is also renowned for being spotted on video heckling and calling Sean Bielat, Barney’s 2010 opponent for his congressional seat, “dude.” James is an avid gardener, and when Barney had stopped by Ogunquit for a visit, Mr. Ready was arrested for cultivation and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, which explains James’ public use of the word “dude.” Although Frank was on the premises during the arrest, the Massachusetts congressman claimed he knew nothing and told police he didn’t “live in the house and that he only smoked cigars.” Unlike James, who spends a lot of time kicking around out back in the pea patch, Congressman Frank said he was “surprised and disappointed with what police found,” and that he wouldn’t “recognize a marijuana plant if he saw one because he is ‘not a great outdoorsman,’ and ‘wouldn’t recognize most plants.'” Three years later, Barney’s original “surprise and disappointment” turned into activism because the cigar-smoking congressman, when referring to the Frank/Paul Pot Bill, said that “The notion that you lock people up for smoking marijuana is pretty silly. I’m going to call it the ‘Make Room for Serious Criminals’ bill.” Never deviating from the libertarian platform whether it’s legalizing pot or maintaining a foreign policy position of non-intervention, Ron Paul is predictable and, although viewed as eccentric at times, remains pretty much controversy-free. Then there’s Barney Frank, who has a scandal-ridden past that includes a history with gay prostitutes and associations with pot-growing and weed-toking male friends, as well as making verbal reassurances that have been proved economically devastating such as: “Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac–are not facing any kind of financial crisis.” Although Barney Frank claims to be “particularly irked by DEA raids and federal prosecution of medical marijuana patients and providers in California,” proposing legislation could be what remedies Barney’s history of public humiliation. All Barney needs to do is find a congressional colleague who’ll sign on to enact laws that take the sting out of embarrassing situations. For example, legalize growing and smoking pot, and in the future Frank can visit James Ready in Maine without the fear of being caught up in a drug raid. For years, Ron Paul has spoken out on behalf of legalizing prostitution; maybe the duo can get a Barney and Ron Bunny Ranch Bill going, which means that when Frank hires con men to run errands it won’t matter if personal aides work part-time from home. And with the pesky issue of discounted ferry tickets, maybe the congressman can push through a bill that exempts public employees from paying full price on ferry rides to islands that serve underrepresented minority groups. As for the Freddie and Fannie fiasco, it’s a little late for legislation to gloss over that debacle. However, for future reference maybe after Barney and Ron’s cannabis connection helps the two men cultivate a closer relationship, Barney will check with Ron before reassuring the public that government involvement in the housing market is a good thing, especially if you happen to be head of the House Committee on Financial Services at the time. Nevertheless, Ron Paul and Barney Frank are banding together as brothers to smooth relations between state law and a confused federal government that intermittently deploys DEA agents to raid dispensaries in jurisdictions that allow the sale of medical marijuana. As they do, it is nice to know that legalizing pot will also help bring Barney Frank, despite past indiscretions, one step closer to legitimacy."

Even 40% of Americans who are personally against the legalization of marijuana were in favor of federalism. The Federal Controlled Substances Act prohibits marijuana use, and state laws such as those in Washington and Colorado are in conflict with it. According to the poll, 60% of Americans aged 18 to 29 support legalizing marijuana while about as many of those 65 and older are opposed. The bulk of middle-aged Americans those aged 30 to 64 are split on the issue. Among Republicans, 66% believe marijuana should be legalized while 33% support legalization. Democrats favor legalization, with 61% in support and 38% opposed to legalization. Independents are split, with 50% supporting legalization and 47% in opposition. Fifty percent of Americans believe marijuana should not be legal while 48% believe it should be."
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2013/12/31/Colorado-Predicts-More-Than-500-Million-In-Marijuana-Sales-Next-Year/,breitbart.com,Colorado Predicts More Than $500 Million in Marijuana Sales in 2014,Frances Martel,12-31-2013,,"Colorado medical marijuana shops are expecting a “very festive” atmosphere at 8 AM tomorrow, when they will be able to open their doors to anyone willing to buy the drug. The state has predicted that 2014 will see a $571.1 million profit on legal marijuana sales in 2014, all of it taxed. A Bloomberg report on the eve that marijuana legalization takes effect in Colorado notes that the state also expects $67 million in tax revenue alone from those nearly $600 million in profits. The profits will go in part to funding schools, and only those over the age of 21 can buy marijuana at legally licensed stores. The stores opening tomorrow morning were already in existence, selling their product medically to those with a prescription. No new shops may legally open until July. Shop owners are reporting long lines of people already camping out in front of their stores. One shop owner told Bloomberg she was preparing by buying heaters and bringing over a food truck to help those camping out. Others report the lines are expected later tonight. These reports are in stark contrast to predictions from earlier this month; the AP previously cited experts from the Medical Marijuana Council saying this December that Colorado was not going to be “Wal-Mart on Black Friday” and many users might be “disappointed.” The cause for concern at the time was that many of the eligible dispensaries had yet to receive their licenses, and there was a palpable worry that they may not file the paperwork in time for a January 1 opening. By the time the red tape cleared and shops all around the state received their licenses, the tone of reporting shifted to a concern that the demand for the drug would not be met by the few shops opening. The long lines seem to indicate that this, rather than dispensaries not functioning at all, is the problem people will most likely face tomorrow. As the doors open to legalized marijuana in Colorado, the two-tiered legality of the drug raises serious concerns for how the market will run. As marijuana is still illegal on a federal level, the Department of Justice reserves the right to arrest and prosecute people for selling or possessing it. Since marijuana continues to be illegal federally, it also makes the market a fully cash one, as banks cannot aid in the distribution of illegal products. While President Obama has said he has no interest in using the long arm of the law to arrest those who possess the drug in legal states, his record on marijuana arrests is striking in its forcefulness. The President also reserves the right to change his mind."

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2015/10/21/cdc-marijuana-surpasses-cigarette-smoking-high-school/,breitbart.com,CDC: Marijuana Surpasses Cigarette Smoking in High School,Dr. Susan Berry,10-21-2015,,"A report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) finds the proportion of high school seniors who smoke marijuana is higher than the proportion that smokes cigarettes. According to the report, since 2010, the proportion of U.S. high school seniors who smoked pot during the preceding 30 days was 21.4 percent, while the proportion that smoked cigarettes was 19.2 percent. CDC indicates it analyzed data from the 1997–2013 national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS) among U.S. white, black, and Hispanic students in grades 9–12 to study patterns in the use of cigarette, cigar, and marijuana smoking. According to the study, from 1997 to 2013, a 64% percent decrease was observed in the percentage of U.S. white, black, and Hispanic high school students overall who smoked cigarettes or cigars exclusively. Also, among white students, any cigarette, cigar, or marijuana smoking declined during the study period. CDC continues: Among black and Hispanic students, any cigarette, cigar, or marijuana use decreased from 1997 to 2007, but increased among black students from 2007 to 2013, and did not change for Hispanics from 2007 to 2013. Moreover, the percentage of white, black, and Hispanic students overall who were exclusive marijuana users more than doubled, and marijuana use among cigarette or cigar users also increased, with substantial increases identified among black and Hispanic students toward the end of the study period. The results show, says CDC, that whatever strides have been made in adolescent health due to lower cigarette and cigar use might be attenuated by increases in marijuana use, which vary by racial/ethnic subgroup. “Increased exclusive marijuana use and use of marijuana among cigarette or cigar users could undermine success in reducing tobacco use among youths,” CDC states. “Closer collaboration between public health professionals to address prevention of tobacco and marijuana use might be beneficial in the development of evidence-based policies and programs to prevent tobacco and marijuana use.” The study comes as more states and nations are considering relaxing laws about marijuana use or even legalizing its use entirely. According to Dr. Christopher Hammond, writing at Psychiatric Times last December, “[T]he effects of marijuana use during adolescence and possible short- and long-term consequences are a growing concern.” Hammond writes: Converging scientific evidence from preclinical studies, human neuroimaging, and large longitudinal studies suggests that adolescent-onset marijuana use, particularly heavy marijuana use, is associated with a number of neuropsychiatric sequelae including neurocognitive deficits and reductions in IQ, increased risk for psychosis, affective disorders, marijuana and non-marijuana drug addiction, and lower academic attainment. Also at Psychiatric Times, Dr. Robin Murray warns, “Psychological dependence and tolerance can occur with cannabis. It remains in the body for several weeks, so withdrawal is very gradual but anxiety, insomnia, appetite disturbance, and depression can develop.” “Some reports claim that in 10% of persons who use cannabis and in 25% of daily users, dependence develops,” Murray continues. “Cannabis dependence is an increasingly common reason why patients seek help from drug treatment clinics.” Murray observes that longitudinal studies conducted in Australia and New Zealand have found that daily marijuana use before age 17 was associated with “clear reductions” in the probability of graduating from high school and college. “Those starting cannabis use early also appear more likely to develop cognitive impairment,” Murray adds, noting that another study has shown that long-term heavy cannabis users who began smoking before age 17 had lower verbal IQ scores than those who began smoking at age 17 or older. Though the political trend is toward relaxing laws on marijuana, the outcome of a pattern in this direction is unknown. If legalization produces an increase in consumption, the impact on young teens – who are apparently most vulnerable to marijuana’s harmful effects – remains a disturbing question."
https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/08/31/federal-court-gun-ban-marijuana-card-holders-constitutional/,breitbart.com,Court: Gun Ban for Marijuana Card Holders Is Constitutional,AWR Hawkins,08-31-2016,,"On August 31, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the ban on gun sales to marijuana card holders is constitutional. The lawsuit was filed by S. Rowan Wilson, a Nevada resident who was denied a firearm purchase in 2011 “after obtaining a medical marijuana card.” According to the Associated Press, the gun store told Wilson she could not purchase the gun because of a federal law barring marijuana card holders from purchasing firearms. Although some states have legalized marijuana–whether for recreational use or as a medical aide–the drug remains illegal on the federal level. And “the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has told gun sellers they can assume a person with a medical marijuana card uses the drug,” which means they cannot pass a federal background check for a gun purchase. Form 4473 of the background check process asks if the would-be firearm purchaser is “an unlawful user of…marijuana.” No one who answers “yes” to that question can purchase a gun. The Ninth Circuit panel ruled unanimously in favor of the gun ban. Senior District Judge Jed Rakoff said banning firearms sales to marijuana users is “reasonable” because using the drug “raises the risk of irrational or unpredictable behavior with which gun use should not be associated.”"

Seeks to More Than Double Pot Tax Just 7 Months After Legalization,Daniel J. Flynn,06-14-2017,,"Less than a year after Massachusetts voters approved legalizing marijuana and taxing it at a rate of 12 percent, lawmakers already seek a larger take of the dealer’s cut. In shifting marijuana from decriminalized to legal status, voters permitted a maximum tax of 12 percent on sales of the sweet leaf. Seven months later, the state legislature seeks to grab more of pot profits by permitting taxes as high as 28 percent. It’s not as though those in the reefer business didn’t see the state coming for their business. Nine years ago, I sat down with two longtime pot dealers in the Beacon Hill Pub a short walk from where the Great and General Court does business. The sixtysomething sinsemilla sectaries viewed legalization as a way to corporatize a mom-and-pop enterprise. “Should it be legal? Yes. Do we want it legal? No,” declared cue-balled “Charlie,” dealing for decades within eyeshot of the state capitol. “Mark,” sporting a Pancho Villa mustache, informed, “Every time I go over to Hempfest, I chant: ‘Keep Marijuana Illegal.” At the time, a pot legalization proposal sought to impose a $150-an-ounce tax on the low-grade marijuana most commonly bought and smoked. In effect, the proposal aimed to double the price of a joint. This go-around, the proposed law allows for an end-around on the taxes by smokers using “medical” marijuana, which the bill exempts from the proposed taxation. “If you had to pay the licensing fee, it wouldn’t necessarily be cost prohibitive,” Mark explained. “But with the taxes, your clientele is going to disappear. A lot of people would just balk at paying that.” Apart from raising taxes, the 48-page omnibus bill currently before the Great and General Court seeks to expand a cannabis board to five members, prohibit localities from enforcing laws against the transportation or delivery of pot, maintain a database on people using medical marijuana, and seize weed from those, such as Charlie and Mark, not given the state’s imprimatur to sell. The proposed law authorizes investigations and audits of the pot dispensaries. It imposes stringent testing on the product. And it directs the authorized marijuana dealers to “abide by an affirmative action program” in hiring. For pot dealers not keen on turning over their profits to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or eager to undergo annual audits, the law establishes a “division of cannabis enforcement” in the attorney general’s office regarding a product that voters just legalized and long ago decriminalized. Ironically, veteran dealers such as Mark and Charlie face a government more eager to put them out of business now than when they peddled an illegal product as consumers may boost their business by more enthusiastically turning to their cheaper, black-market pot. The more than 54 percent who voted to legalize marijuana in November’s election authorized a tax of no more than 12 percent. The 28 percent tax represents a 133 percent increase over the initial rate. Legislators seek to hold a vote on Thursday. Smoking citizens may counter by voting with their wallets."

Duterte later told reporters he was of course joking, trying to keep a rambling speech about how much he disliked the experience of attending this years Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit from getting too boring. Duterte was speaking at an event celebrating the Philippine Organizing Committee that put together the countrys delegation to ASEAN. The Philippine president typically deviates from the main themes of events he attends in his remarks, instead taking time to discuss matters of interest to him, such as his distaste for the Catholic Church. Last week, he threatened to decapitate a Philippine bishop for allegedly buying drugs, a claim Duterte did not back with evidence. At the ASEAN event in Manila Monday, Duterte took the time to detail his many complaints about the conference, calling it a killing activity, implying that the world leaders who attend spend most of their time there slowly dying inside. Me, not so much, he added, because I take marijuana to stay awake. It doesnt work, with others. Duterte used Sultan of BruneiHassanal Bolkiah as an example of one of the world leaders who fell asleep during the event. Just between us, but Bolkiah slept during the events, Duterte said during the public speech at the presidential palace Monday. He has a talent to make it appear that he was not sleeping, so it is as if he is contemplating his oil. Duterte also complained about the awful food at the event, claiming he had to bring his own canned meats and eat them in his hotel room to avoid consuming catered ASEAN food for heads of state. The food sucked. Jesus, Mary,and Joseph, its true, Duterte protested. I have to bring Karne Norte and dried fish. He went on to complain that the heads of the ASEAN think were boy scouts and overbook each world leaders schedules. I cant take it, he added. The ASEAN conference occurred last month in Papua New Guinea. At the time, Duterte skipped several significant meetings at ASEAN and went on to skip four meetings scheduled at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in Singapore, which occurred immediately after the ASEAN summit. He also skipped the ASEAN gala, which he hosted in 2017 when the Philippines organized it. Dutertes presidential spokesman, Salvador Panelo, told reporters that Duterte skipped the meetings for power naps necessary due to the punishing schedule he faced. Dutertes remarks about marijuana have triggered the most outrage, as police have killed thousands of Philippine nationals in shootouts since Duterte took office in 2016, vowing to kill the nations drug criminals and eradicate illicit drug use entirely. Marijuana use is illegal in the Philippines. An estimated 5,000 people have died since Duterte took office in incidents related to law enforcement against drug crime. The first police convictions for wrongful killing of drug suspects occurred on Friday; Duterte has vowed to pardon officers who kill Philippine citizens suspected of using or trafficking in drugs. Asked to clarify his remarks Monday, Duterte said, Of course I was joking. I want to shake a tree in the middle of a [speech]. He added that his speech would be boring if he did not make jokes and that this was part of his style. Its too late to change, he concluded, adding, If you believe it, you are stupid. In an interview in 2016,Duterte issued support for legalizing medical marijuana, insisting that cannabis is really an ingredientof modern medicine now. There are medicines right now being developed or already in the market that contains marijuana as a component but used for medical purposes. Yet he rejected the idea of smoking cannabis recreationally, warning that those who fight the law by using it in the manner will die. Rappler added that Duterte has previously admitted , without claiming to be joking, to the use of fentanyl , an extremely addictive and dangerous opioid believed to have played a role in nearly half the opioid overdose deaths in the United States in 2017. Duterte claimed to use fentanyl in a patch form to relieve chronic back pain."

The most recent seizure occurred Saturday when personnel from the Tijuana municipal police responded to a 911 call in colonia Caadas del Florido on Calle de la Pantera, where they located an abandoned Mitsubishi Outlander parked in front of a residence. Police observed numerous plastic bags containing a white granular substance inside cardboard boxes. Local reports note that a total of 77 bags containing methamphetamineweighing 170 pounds were discovered. Police then looked into the residence and observed more bags. The Mexican Army provided security while a search warrant was signed. The following morning, investigative personnel from the federal attorney generals office entered the residence and discovered an active methamphetamine lab with precursor chemicals and equipment. The total weight of methamphetamine seized from the vehicle and premises came to 661 pounds, according to another local report . No information was released pertaining to arrests. In the second seizure of methamphetamine, investigative personnel of the state police stopped two males driving a 1999 Ford Ranger in colonia Manuel Paredes I on Saturday. Intelligence was developed to indicate the two individuals were possibly transporting a load of methamphetamine, according to a statement released by police . During the traffic stop, police conducted a search of the vehicle and discovered large plastic boxes loaded with methamphetamine, weighing nearly 253 pounds. The two males who were identified asLorenzo N, 27, and Jorge N, 20. In the third seizure, investigative personnel from the federal prosecutors office along with elements from the Mexican Army served a search warrant Friday in a warehouse located inthe Paseo de los Hroes en Zona Urbana Ro section. Investigative personnel discovered 3 tons of marijuana packed in cardboard boxes. No further information was released. The turf war over the street sale of methamphetamine between rival criminal gangs aligned with the major cartels is blamed for the record-breaking number of killings in the border city abutting California."
