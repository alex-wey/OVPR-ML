But some owners of the famous Dutch coffee shops are staying mellow. Fittingly, in a land renowned for its relaxed attitude to drug laws, the new rules contain a few loopholes. People will still be able to smoke pure cannabis joints in around 700 coffee shops, something some tourists -- notably from the United States -- already often do. Also, restaurants, cafes and coffee shops will be allowed to set up a separate room or glass partition behind which people can smoke. But customers will not be served in these areas to protect staff. This dispensation makes the Dutch law more relaxed than smoking restrictions in some other European countries where smoking is banned completely in bars, restaurants and other public spaces."

One study you may have read about. The other has been ignored entirely by the mainstream media. But no doubt the results of both will surprise you. First, the study you may have heard of. Writing August 3 in the journal Cancer Epidemiology , investigators at McGill University in Montreal reported that moderate alcohol consumption -- defined as six drinks or fewer per week -- by adults is positively associated with an elevated risk of various cancers, including stomach cancer, rectal cancer, and bladder cancer. And now for the study you haven't heard of. Writing in the August issue of the journal Cancer Prevention Research , investigators from Rhode Island's Brown University, along with researchers at Boston University, Louisiana State University, and the University of Minnesota reported that lifetime marijuana use is associated with a ""significantly reduced risk"" of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Authors reported, ""after adjusting for potential confounders (including smoking and alcohol drinking), 10 to 20 years of marijuana use was associated with a significantly reduced risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNDCC)."" Perhaps even more notably, subjects who smoked marijuana and consumed alcohol and tobacco (two known high risk factors for head and neck cancers) also experienced a reduced risk of cancer, the study found. "" Our study suggests that moderate marijuana use is associated with reduced risk of HNSCC ,"" investigators concluded. ""This association was consistent across different measures of marijuana use (marijuana use status, duration, and frequency of use)....Further, we observed that marijuana use modified the interaction between alcohol and cigarette smoking, resulting in a decreased HNSCC risk among moderate smokers and light drinkers, and attenuated risk among the heaviest smokers and drinkers."" This isn't the first time that U.S. investigators have documented an inverse association between pot use and cancer. A separate 2006 population case-control study, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and conducted by the University of California at Los Angeles, also reported that lifetime use of cannabis was not positively associated with cancers of the lung or aerodigestive tract, and further noted that certain moderate users of the drug experienced a reduced cancer risk compared to non-using controls. Predictably, the federal government's goal when green-lighting the UCLA study was to conclusively establish just the opposite result, as explained recently by its lead researcher Dr. Donald Tashkin. In an interview with the McClatchy newspaper chain in June, Dr. Tashkin admitted that he expected his study would find that pot was associated with ""increased health effects."" Instead, he summarized, ""What we found instead was no association (between marijuana smoking and cancer) and even a suggestion of some protective effect."" Tashkin added, ""[A]t this point, I'd be in favor of (marijuana) legalization. I wouldn't encourage anybody to smoke any substances. But I don't think it should be stigmatized as an illegal substance. Tobacco smoking causes far more harm. And in terms of an intoxicant, alcohol causes far more harm (than marijuana)."" Despite these findings, which to date inexplicably remain under-reported by the mainstream press, many so-called experts persist with claims that marijuana smoking is causally linked to cancer. In fact, in June the California Environmental Protection Agency with great fanfare added marijuana smoke to its list of chemicals that possess potential carcinogenic properties and/or are associated with reproductive toxicity. You know what other commonly indulged in substance also appears on this list? That would be alcohol. Of course that conclusion, much like the reports of marijuana's anti-cancer prowess, apparently went up in smoke."

The legal trouble gets worse for Pastman, 50: his apartment is right above a preschool. A dog barking out an open window in the building attracted officers’ attention. Given the cold temperatures, they decided to check on the dog’s owner. When they entered the building, they immediately detected an “overwhelming” odor of ganja. They knocked on Pastman’s door, who admitted that he’d been growing pot and allowed the officers to enter his home and seize his (apparently quite elaborate) irrigation, lighting and ventilation systems, as well as a number of cannabis plants. Pastman has been charged with felony manufacturing and delivery within 1,000 feet of a school, which means his crime is automatically a Class 1 felony, according to Illinois marijuana statutes."
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/can-medical-marijuana-help-arthritis_n_873189,huffpost.com,Medical Marijuana For Rheumatoid Arthritis?,Health.com,06-08-2011,,"Steve is a horticulturist of sorts. He raises orchids, Japanese maples, and other plants at his southern Rhode Island home. Tending the plants helps ease his rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pain, he says. But the garden offers more than Zen; he grows one plant -- marijuana -- specifically to relieve RA pain and discomfort. ""If my pain is at a 10, it will take it down to a 6 or 6.5,"" he says. ""Im an old-man weight lifter. After I smoke I am able to work my shoulders and arms to keep my joints healthy. It gives me the desire and ability to get through a workout."" Steve has had permission to grow marijuana for medicinal purposes since 2006. He smokes it and cooks it in butter (for baking) and makes THC-containing solutions called tinctures (which can be added to foods and drinks) for himself and five other patients with various medical conditions. His home state is 1 of 16, along with the District of Columbia, where marijuana is permitted for medicinal use. Cannabis may be useful for people with RA and other chronic pain conditions because it can alleviate pain, reduce inflammation, and promote sleep. But unlike other pain-causing conditions, such as osteoarthritis, RA is associated with a higher risk of lung problems and heart attacks. (RA is an autoimmune condition that attacks the joints and causes multiple health problems.) Its not clear if smoking marijuana is a relatively safe pain reliever for people with RA, or if it could increase the risk of RA-associated conditions. And if cannabis is safe, its still debatable whether its safer to take it as a pill or mouth spray rather than smoking it. Smoking marijuana raises the heart rate and one study found that heart-attack risk rises fivefold in the hour after lighting up, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Medical marijuana remains controversial -- and thus under-studied -- in part because it is the most commonly abused illicit drug in the U.S. How marijuana works There are hundreds of chemicals in marijuana, but the best known is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. THC is what produces the high that comes with smoking or eating products made from marijuana. But THC also binds with receptors in the brain that produce an analgesic affect. It may also reduce anxiety experienced by some people dealing with chronic pain. Marijuana is typically smoked, which produces the most rapid delivery into the bloodstream, says Kathryn Cunningham, Ph.D., director of the Center for Addiction Research at the University of Texas Medical Branch, in Galveston. It can also be taken through vaporization (heated into a mist and inhaled), and in edible products, such as baked goods and tinctures, which take longer to have an effect because they have to be broken down in the stomach, Cunningham says. There are also drugs such as Marinol (dronabinol) and Cesamet (nabilone), which are synthetic versions of THC in pill form that are available by prescription for AIDS patients and cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, and a newer product called Sativex, a mouth spray with THC and cannabidiol. Sativex is not yet available in the United States, but is used in Canada and Europe for pain relief in people with cancer and multiple sclerosis. Marijuana is illegal on the federal level, but medicinal marijuana is permitted in some states, including Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Each state has its own guidelines including conditions it can be used for and possession limits (which range from 1 ounce to 24 ounces). Marijuana can be purchased through dispensaries, but most states also allow people to grow the product. Research is limited Medicinal marijuana isnt regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, and there arent large-scale studies of its safety and efficacy for chronic pain conditions. (It doesnt help that there are few manufacturers to fund research.) But there have been some small-scale studies looking at its use. A 2006 study in Rheumatology looked at 58 RA patients over a five-week period. They were split into two groups -- one taking Sativex and the other a placebo. The group on Sativex had improvements in ""morning pain on movement"" and sleep quality compared to placebo users. (The study was funded by GW Pharmaceuticals, which makes Sativex.) ""This is a good example of how to answer the question with scientifically sound experiments,"" Cunningham says, adding that larger studies are needed. ""We dont know how the drug affects the disease process, but it does seem to have a positive analgesic effect on RA."" Doctors at the University of Toronto and Dalhousie University in Halifax reviewed 18 clinical trials that included 766 people between 2003 and 2010. The trials studied the use of cannabis -- either smoked or in THC-based prescription products -- as a medical therapy for non-cancer-related pain, most often neuropathic pain (chronic pain that is usually due to nerve damage). Fifteen of the trials found that it worked better than a placebo for pain relief and four trials found that it improved patients sleep. A majority of the studies found that side effects like sedation, dry mouth, dizziness, and disturbed concentration were mild enough that people did not drop out of the studies. However, the analysis included only one study of RA patients -- the same 2006 Sativex study -- so it could not determine if the long-term use of smoked marijuana was associated with a higher risk of heart or lung complications. Potential health risks Smoking marijuana can increase a persons heart rate for up to three hours, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Marijuana also contains carcinogens (possibly 50 percent to 70 percent more than cigarettes), making smoking potentially harmful to RA patients, who may already suffer from lung problems. The Institute on Drug Abuse, however, reported that no studies have linked marijuana use to lung or upper respiratory cancers. Safety of unregulated products is also always a concern. John Oram, Ph.D., cofounder of CW Analytical, a California-based scientific lab that tests medical marijuana products for safety, quality, and potency, says that more than 90 percent of what is on the market is safe. ""But about 10 percent or less is dangerous, and we dont know how unsafe it is and what problems it may cause,"" he says. Oram adds that labs like CW Analytical empower patients and doctors to make informed decisions about their alternative medicine options. Hazards of these products can include things like bacteria and mold, which would be illegal to sell in regulated food items. Some products may also be prepared in kitchens that arent licensed, may not adhere to refrigeration schedules, or may be made with allergens like peanuts, but not labeled as such. Oram says products should be tested within seven to eight weeks of purchase because that is the shelf life of cannabis. The dispensaries should have records of the date a product was tested for mold, yeast, bacteria, and pesticides, as well as its potency (or amount of THC). Not all doctors prescribe medicinal marijuana, even in states where it is permitted. Ogechi ""Helen"" Mbakwe, M.D., from Central Washington Internal Medicine and Endocrine Center, in Yakima, doesnt. Dr. Mbakwe is uncomfortable with the lack of control and regulation of medicinal marijuana. She says other medications, like methotrexate, treat the autoimmune disease at the root of the problem, and in turn can control pain and inflammation in combination with pain medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . (Methotrexate and other drugs are known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, or DMARDs, because they can actually slow down or prevent RAs damaging effect on the body.) On the other hand, while marijuana may help with pain symptoms, it does nothing for the disease progression or organ damage, Dr. Mbakwe says. ""If we mask these [symptoms] by giving them marijuana and giving them euphoria, the disease progression will keep getting worse and things like organ damage and severe problems will still occur,"" she notes. Steve, who has RA and lost one of his kidneys in 2004 after being diagnosed with cancer, feels he doesnt have a lot of choices to manage his pain. Many RA medications can be harmful to the kidneys, and that is one reason he says he opts for marijuana to treat his symptoms. Patients with kidney problems can still take DMARDs as long as their dose is adjusted and they are monitored closely, Dr. Mbakwe says. ""DMARDs are not simply pain medications and are not interchangeable with pain medications. So the question of exchanging an RA medication with marijuana should not arise."" Another problem that Dr. Mbakwe encounters is that, even though she doesnt recommend marijuana to her RA patients, she has many who use it for pain, and she says these patients often have a tendency to abuse narcotics. ""Most patients looking for this have other chronic pain issues and are likely on other controlled substances,"" Dr. Mbakwe says. ""It can be difficult to see who has a tendency toward abuse potential."" Gregory A. Smith, M.D., medical director of the Los Angelesbased Comprehensive Pain Relief Group, is a pain management and addiction specialist. He says marijuana is not a drug, like methamphetamine, that you take once and are physically dependent upon. ""Marijuana does not have that kind of chemical reaction in the brain,"" he says. ""It is safer than a lot of the prescription narcotics that I detox people from."" About 28 million people try marijuana each year, and only between 8 percent and 10 percent of users exhibit addictive behavior like drug seeking, Cunningham says. ""What we need to know is if it is addicting in pain patients and is it more so than opiate medications,"" which are commonly used to treat chronic pain, she says. In the meantime, some patients will continue to use marijuana even though large studies havent tested its safety and efficacy. Steve, who has been using marijuana for 30 years (long before it was medically legal), smokes a bowl and a half every day and more at night. He says this helps him sleep and relieves pain, and he hasnt experienced any major side effects over the years, but admits that it can precipitate what he calls ""couch lock."" ""It makes you lazy,"" he says."

Investors may be able to apply that same bit of wisdom to the growing number of U.S. states that have legalized pot. Although federal law prohibits the sale or possession of marijuana, Massachusetts last week joined the ranks of states 18 plus Washington, D.C. that allow its use for people suffering from chronic illnesses like cancer, HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. In Washington and Colorado, meanwhile, voters passed an initiative to allow pot for recreational use. Those changes have kickstarted a small but fast-growing medical-marijuana industry, estimated to be worth about $1.7 billion as of 2011, according to See Change Strategy, an independent financial-analysis firm that specializes in new markets. In Colorado alone, sales topped $181 million in 2010, and the business employed 4,200 state-licensed workers, says Aaron Smith, executive director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, a nonprofit trade group that campaigns for marijuanas federal legalization. In addition to profiting itself from growing and selling marijuana, the industry benefits a slew of other businesses, such as insurers, lawyers and agricultural-equipment firms, experts say. Call it the green rush, says Derek Peterson, CEO of GrowOp Technology, an online retailer of hydroponics products used in the cultivation of indoor plants and a subsidiary of OTC stock Terra Tech. The industry is expanding, and there are all kinds of investment opportunities. For regular investors looking to get in on the action and without having to actually grow or sell drugs there are several small-cap stocks that stand to gain from marijuanas growing acceptance. Medbox, an OTC stock with a $45 million market cap, for example, sells its patented dispensing machines to licensed medical-marijuana dispensaries. The machines, which dispense set doses of the drug, after verifying patients identities via fingerprint, could potentially be used in ordinary drugstores too, says Medbox founder Vincent Mehdizadeh. Based in Hollywood, Calif., the company already has 130 machines in the field, and it expects to install an additional 40 in the next quarter. The smart money is trying to help with compliance and transparency, Mehdizadeh says. Of course, investing in drugs the federal government still outlaws poses enormous risks to investors, says Sam Kamin, a law professor and the director of the Constitutional Rights & Remedies Program at the University of Denver. In fact, nearly 500 of the estimated 3,000 dispensaries nationwide have either been closed by the federal government or shut down in the past year, says a spokesman for StickyGuide.com, an online directory and review site for medical marijuana dispensaries and yet another ancillary business thats currently seeking investors."

""Cannabinoids have a complex action; it hits a number of important processes that cancers need to survive,"" study author Dr. Wai Liu, an oncologist at St. George's University of London, told XXX. ""For that reason, it has really good potential over other drugs that only have one function. I am impressed by its activity profile, and feel it has a great future, especially if used with standard chemotherapies."" Liu's study was recently published in the journal Anticancer Research. It was supported by funding from GW Pharmaceuticals, which already makes a cannabis-derived drug used to treat spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis. The study looked at the effects of six different non-psychoactive cannabinoids -- compounds derived from marijuana that do not cause the ""high"" associated with its THC ingredient -- when applied alone, and in combination, to leukemia cells. Cannabinoids displayed a ""diverse range of therapeutic qualities"" that ""target and switch off"" pathways that allow cancers to grow, Liu told U.S. News & World Report . Liu stressed to XXX that his research was built around the testing of the six purified cannabinoid forms -- not traditional cannabis oil, which Liu described as ""crude"" in comparison and generally containing 80-100 different cannabinoids. ""We do not really know which are the ones that will be anticancer and those that may be harmful,"" Liu said. During the study, Liu and his team grew leukemia cells in a lab and cultured them with increasing doses of the six pure cannabinoids, both individually and in combination with each other. His study says the six cannabinoids were CBD (Cannabidiol), CBDA (Cannabidiolic acid), CBG (Cannbigerol), CBGA (Cannabigerolic acid), CBGV (Cannabigevarin) and CBGVA (Cannabigevaric acid). Liu and his team then assessed the viability of the leukemia cells and determined whether or not the cannabinoids destroyed the cells or stopped them from growing. Although promising, Liu also said that it remains unclear if the cannabinoid treatment would work on the 200-plus existing types of cancer. ""Cancer is an umbrella term for a range of diseases that fundamentally differ in their cellular makeup, [and] which occur as a result of disturbances to growth controls,"" Liu said. ""Chemotherapy works by disrupting these dysfunctional growth signals. Therefore, any cancers that have these profiles should respond to the chemotherapy. It just so happens that a number of cannabinoids can target these very same mechanisms that make cancer what it is, and so any cancer that exhibits these faults should respond well to cannabinoids. The flip side is, of course, that other cancers may not have these same genetic faults and so cannabinoids may not work as well."" According to the Centers for Disease Control, 7.6 million people die from various forms of cancer each year worldwide. When asked if smoking marijuana has the same or similar effects as ingesting the pure cannabinoid compounds he studied, Liu said he thinks it's unlikely. ""Smoking cannabis introduces a number of potential problems,"" Liu said. ""First, the complex makeup of cannabis that contains about 80 bioactive substances means that the desired anticancer effect may be lost because these compounds may interfere with each other. Second, we see that delivering the drug either by injection or by a tablet would ensure the most effective doses are given. Smoking would be variable, and indeed the heat of the burning may actually destroy the useful nature of the compounds."" In 2012, researchers at the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco found that CBD (cannbidiol), a non-toxic, non-psychoactive chemical compound found in the cannabis plant, could stop metastasis in many kinds of aggressive cancer . The National Cancer Institute has also funded some research into cannabis and cancer , including a 2012 study that looked at the effects cannabis compounds have on slowing the progression of breast cancer , spokesman Michael Miller told U.S. News and World Report. However NCI has not funded research on the effects of cannabinoids on leukemia. Liu stressed that much work is still needed, and said that finding support for marijuana-derived medicines can be polarizing. ""Although there is much promise, I struggle to find enough support to drive this work on,"" Liu said. ""The mention of cannabinoids can polarize the public, who understandably link cannabis smoking with cannabis-derived drugs."" Liu told the Seattle PI's Pot Blog that he hopes to start clinical trials involving humans in 12 to 18 months."

The survey was conducted by Medscape between Feb. 25 and March 3, and is based on answers from 1,544 physicians from 12 different specialty areas. Doctors in certain specialties seemed to better acknowledge the benefits of medical marijuana than others. Eighty-two percent of oncologists and hematologists, for instance, said patients can experience real benefits from medical marijuana; the same percentage of doctors in these two specialities also said they think patients should have medical marijuana as an option. In states where medical marijuana is not legal, about half of doctors surveyed said it should be made legal; the results were about the same in states still considering legalizing medical marijuana. However, more than half of doctors -- 53 percent -- did not support the legalization of recreational marijuana use. In a companion consumer survey conducted by WebMD , taken by 2,960 random visitors to the WebMD website between Feb. 23 and Feb. 26, the percentages in support of the legalization of medical marijuana were similar. Half supported its nationwide legalization, and for people living in states where it's not legalized, half said it should be made legal. Fifty-one percent of people from the WebMD survey said they do not support the legalization of recreational marijuana use. Just last year, results of a poll published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that three out of four doctors would prescribe medical marijuana to a patient experiencing painful symptoms from advanced breast cancer."

The new study , published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research , found that broken bones healed faster and stronger when the patient received the non-psychoactive compound cannabidiol, or CBD. ""We found that CBD alone makes bones stronger during healing, enhancing the maturation of the collagenous matrix, which provides the basis for new mineralization of bone tissue,"" said Dr. Yankel Gabet, one of the lead researchers, in a statement. ""After being treated with CBD, the healed bone will be harder to break in the future."" Researchers administered CBD to a group of rats with mid-femoral fractures. After just eight weeks, they saw marked improvement in the broken bones. They injected another group of rats with a mixture of CBD and THC, marijuana's psychoactive ingredient. Comparing the results, they concluded that CBD alone was an effective treatment. Researchers explained that humans have a naturally occurring endocannabinoid system, which regulates a number of physiological processes as well as the skeleton. The human brain and body are thus prepped to be responsive to cannabinoids, even those from an outside source like marijuana. Gabet of the Bone Research Laboratory at Tel Aviv University and the late professor Itai Bab of the Bone Laboratory at Hebrew University led the research. A number of studies in recent years have demonstrated the medical potential of marijuana. Purified forms of cannabis have been tied to better blood sugar control and may help slow the spread of HIV . A growing body of research suggests CBD may also be effective in reducing inflammation brought on by multiple sclerosis , stopping metastasis in many kinds of aggressive cancer , killing cancerous cells in people with leukemia and serving as an alternative antipsychotic treatment . ""The clinical potential of cannabinoid-related compounds is simply undeniable at this point,"" Gabet said. Seventeen U.S. states have legalized CBD for limited medical use or research, and 23 other states have more broadly legalized marijuana for medical purposes. Still, the federal government continues to ban the plant, classifying it as one of the ""most dangerous"" drugs with "" no currently accepted medical use ."""
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/9-ways-to-use-hemp-oil-in_b_10145990,huffpost.com,9 Ways to Use Hemp Oil In Body Care (And Why You'd Want To),Lisa Bronner,05-26-2016,,"There are a lot of superlative claims about hemp oil: most unsaturated oil, best essential fatty acids (EFA) ratio and combination, highest amino acid variety, only plant source of vitamin D. Can one oil be all that? In short, yes. Before we go further, let me address that unspoken question, ""Will hemp oil make me high?"" No, it won't. Hemp oil is pressed from the seed of the hemp plant, and this seed does not contain THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, which is the psychoactive component of marijuana. However, because of this concern, many hemp oil suppliers provide transparent certifications to assure buyers of the lack of THC content in their products. Test Pledge is one such resource, wherein ""producers and processors of hemp oil and hemp nut must commission THC tests on each and every lot of hemp nut and oil, performed by a properly accredited laboratory according to the official Health Canada protocol."" In their assessment of hemp cosmetics on workplace drug testing, Petra Pless, DEnv, and Gero Leson, D Env, state, ""In case of the highly unlikely full-body application of pure hemp oil with a 10 ppm THC content on partially compromised skin THC uptake could conceivably be raised to 11 g/day. Even this higher rate is only a fraction of the 450 g/day of oral THC intake, found not to result in a positive screening test for marijuana ."" Don't judge hemp because it may have a kooky cousin. That's hardly fair. Who doesn't have an offbeat family member or two? Why Hemp Hemp oil contains unsurpassed essential fatty acids (EFAs). As we are increasingly learning, there are good fats and there are bad fats. What makes a good fat good has much to do with these EFAs, specifically omega-3 and omega-6, which are present in hemp oil in the perfect ratio of 1:3. Plus, hemp oil contains the anti-inflammatory gamma linoleic acid (GLA) as well as omega-9. Its fatty acid profile is better than fish oil's, better than flaxseed oil's--it is the best. Among many benefits, these EFAs provide for more elastic skin and shiny, stronger hair. Hemp oil contains a power-packed punch of additional nutrients , including calcium, potassium, magnesium, copper, vitamin A, vitamin B1 (thiamin), vitamin B3 (niacin), vitamin B5, vitamin B9 (folate), and vitamin D (of which it is the only plant source), along with a useful dose of the antioxidant vitamin E (tocopherols) as well as all 10 amino acids for protein building. Add to that list chlorophyll (that's why it's green), phytosterols, phospholipids, magnesium, sulfur, potassium, phosphorus, and a bit of iron and zinc. Hemp oil is extremely non-comodogenic. In other words, it doesn't clog pores. And because its lipids mirror the lipids that our skin produces naturally, it works in sync with our body to soothe and cleanse. Healthy skin produces linoleic acid. If, for whatever reason, the skin can't produce linoleic acid, it alternatively produces oleic acid, a thick and sticky pore blocker. Hemp oil contains the good linoleic acid. Hemp oil is also a natural humectant, which means it draws moisture into the skin. Instead of sitting on top of the skin the way less-effective oils do, it's able to penetrate the skin, moisturizing between cells and strengthening the cell matrix. It can get to hair roots, as well, strengthening the scalp and reducing dry flaking or dandruff. It evens out skin tone and reduces blotchiness. How to Use It Hemp oil is inexpensive--especially when you think of all the products it replaces: acne treatments, makeup to cover problem areas, moisturizers, and makeup removers, for instance. Here are just a few ways you can use this effective oil in your daily skin and hair care routines. Alleviate dry skin. Rub the oil directly onto dry, cracked skin. For a deep conditioning treatment for hands and feet, massage in the oil then wear socks or gloves overnight to let it work its magic. Strengthen nails and heal cuticles. Massage a small amount of hemp oil directly into nails and cuticles--great for both fingernails and toenails. Remove makeup. Oil follows the ""like dissolves like"" rule, which means that hemp oil will dissolve the oils and waxes in makeup, especially in stubborn eye makeup. Gently rub a small amount of oil into the makeup and wipe with a cotton ball or a soft tissue. Mask overnight . Massage hemp oil into cleansed facial skin before bedtime. Steam facial skin. Massage a tablespoon of oil into the skin on your dry, clean face, massaging for several minutes. Then lay a hot (not scalding) damp washcloth over your face and let it sit until it cools. Wipe with the washcloth. Repeat with another hot washcloth until all the oil is wiped off. Washing your face afterwards is optional. Condition hair. Before shampooing, massage a tablespoon or so of hemp oil into your scalp and let it sit for about 10 minutes. Afterwards, shampoo as normal. You might find you don't need conditioner. Reduce acne. This may sound crazy, but this oil actually reduces acne. Massage hemp oil into problem areas and work it in gently for several minutes. The oil will actually draw out sebum plugs that cause whiteheads, blackheads, and even cysts. Do this daily during breakouts. Relieve eczema . A 2005 study found that 2 tablespoons of dietary hemp seed oil consumed daily may help relieve the effects of atopic dermatitis, or eczema. Support overall health. Eat it. You can eat it straight and enjoy its nutty flavor or you can put it in salad dressings, as a butter replacement on toast, rice, potatoes, vegetables...it's delicious! Keep in mind that pure hemp seed oil cannot be used for high-heat cooking. It has a low smoke point and will totally break down even at a moderate heat, at which point all nutritional benefits are lost. Just remember, pure hemp seed oil goes rancid easily. It needs to be kept in the fridge. However, you can look for it as a shelf-stable ingredient in other personal care products."

My grandma asked if I could check on my grandpa while she was away. Reluctantly, I agreed to check on my grandpa to ease her worry. My grandpa, though I loved him, became a difficult person to be around. His old age and constant pain turned him into a grump, and he felt the need to tell others about his never-ending pain. It was not exactly a visit I was looking forward too. His agitated state became overbearing. People slowly distanced themselves from him, annoyed with his constant negativity. I, like most of my family members, took part in the distancing. Pretending everything was fine was easier, and remembering him as an active gardener was better than looking at the shell of himself he had become. But something had changed and I suddenly found myself face to face with a familiar stranger. Armed with a few subs for lunch and my two dogs, I slipped into the house and found my grandpa watching reruns of Walker Texas Ranger. Happy I was there, he struggled out of his brown recliner to hug me. When he noticed my puppies wagging their excited little poodle tails, he smiled. It had been a long time since that smile made an appearance, and the gesture warmed my heart. We made our way to the dining room table so I could put on his pain patch and we could eat. With only the sound of chewing breaking the silence, I began feeling awkward and desperate for a safe conversation topic. Searching my surroundings as if they held all the answers, I began looking for a flare of inspiration. My eyes landed on a tiny glass vial that contained only about a thimble worth of a crushed plant. I suddenly remembered my grandma telling me he had recently been prescribed medical marijuana. Taking the vial as a conversation saver and blessing in disguise, I asked him if the medical marijuana had been helping at all. Not surprisingly, he told me no, but a smirk curled his lips as he added, it gives me one hell of a high, though! He looked up at me with a glimmer in his eyes that had been missing for several years. The hollows of his face were less prominent, his eyes considerably less sunken, and an un-pained smile spread across his aged face. Believing the lively man sitting across from me was my grandpa was hard, but denying the positive effects of him smiling was impossible. The conversation sparked, and my grandpa proceeded to share with me the how-tos behind smoking. I continued to ask questions about the treatment, despite knowing very little about marijuana. This allowed my now enthused grandpa to keep the conversation going. Wrapped up in the moment, he asked if I wanted to try it with him. He continued by offering to show me how to smoke it from his pipe. Maybe he didnt realize what he was proposing, or he was just proud that he knew something I didnt. The reason didnt matter because it was the most excited I had seen him in years. I kindly declined his offer but let him describe each step in depth. I was a rookie that had never smoked, and I found it far too ironic that it was my grandpa of all people to offer me my first puff of marijuana. I knew he wanted me to try it with him, he probably thought it would be a bonding moment between us, but I preferred to remember corn picking and tractor riding as our thing. While he was telling me about his pipe, and the struggle of learning to use it through this foreign thing called YouTube, I reflected on how much he had changed. Though he still was in some pain, he was easier to be around. He discovered a piece of himself that was almost lost. We ended up enjoying our meal, and I was happy I listened to my grandma. Watching him feed the dogs lunchmeat made me smile at the magic I had witnessed. His new found zest for life could have come from the puppy-love therapy I offered, but I believed most of his recovery was related to the plant carcass he had been smoking. It wasnt a drug meant to get him high, and according to him it didnt help much in the pain department, but it unexpectedly gave my grandpa some of his lost spark. He had some life in him again, and I suspected it was a result from the munchies. His appetite returned, and he began moving around more with his returned strength. If I hadnt witnessed the magic first hand, I never would have believed the miracle that came from the marijuana."

Beauty and wellness products containing cannabidiol (CBD), and possibly tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), are becoming increasingly popular . CBD, along with THC, are the two most common cannabinoids found in cannabis (a.k.a. marijuana), but they have different effects. CBD is touted as having therapeutic and stress-relieving benefits , while THC is responsible for the high associated with marijuana use. Additionally, CBD is legal in many states , while THC is not. You can find cannabis products for a relaxing bath, for soothing sore muscles and for healing chapped lips. Theyve even a found fan in Olivia Wilde, who raved about a topical CBD lotion by Lord Jones in a 2017 New York Times profile . And celebrity stylist Karla Welch has said she tells her clients (like Wilde, Katy Perry and Sarah Paulson) to use it on their feet for red carpet events. Dr. Samer Jaber of Washington Square Dermatology told XXX that while the enthusiasm for cannabinoids in skincare is definitely growing, the science behind cannabis and cannabinoids for skin health is still sparse. A lot of the research focuses on the cannabinoids usefulness in relieving itchiness associated with dry skin and eczema . Cannabinoids also have some anti-inflammatory effects, as well as potential anti-tumor effects , Jaber said, though he added that much more research remains to be done. Unfortunately, most of the studies on the cannabinoids have been done in the laboratory only and there are very few studies on people, Jaber said. So additional well-controlled, clinical studies need to be done to see how effective these ingredients actually are in real life. Another issue with cannabinoids in skincare products is that its difficult to know exactly what youre getting, Jaber said. Since it is not regulated its difficult to know what you are actually putting on your body, he said. Dr. Angela Lamb , director of the Westside Mount Sinai Dermatology Faculty Practice in New York, echoed Jaber, telling XXX, We just do not have any strong research to support beneficial effects on the skin. My aim is to be research-focused in health care. Anyone can make claims, but I want to see what studies have shown, and as it relates to cannabis, there is just not a lot of support yet. It may come in several years, but until then, I think a lot of it is hype, she added. I do not think it is harmful, I am just not sure it helps. As a result of the varying state laws regarding marijuana, much of these products are mainly available in states where marijuana is legal (like California and Colorado) and they often arent available online."

Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has drawn a line in the sand with other presidential hopefuls: a green one. On Monday, Harris told the hosts of the New York City radio show The Breakfast Club that rumors that she didnt support legalization were completely false. Thats not true, she told the shows host Charlamagne Tha God. Half my family is from Jamaica, are you kidding me? Harris later added: I think it gives a lot of people joy, We need more joy in the world. The Democratic senator also admitted to smoking a joint in college and made a subtle dig at President Bill Clinton by adding, and I inhaled a reference to a comment Clinton made during the 1992 campaign when he said he tried cannabis, butdidnt inhale it. Harris wasnt always so high on pot legalization. BuzzFeed notes that when Harris was district attorney of San Francisco in 2010, she opposed Proposition 19, which would have made California the first state to legalize marijuana. Harris also opposed recreational legalization in 2015, but supports a proposed bill to decriminalize the drug by fellow senator and 2020 candidate Cory Booker (D-N.J.), according to The Hill. An October poll by the Pew Research Center suggests that 62 percent of Americans favor legalization of cannabis."
