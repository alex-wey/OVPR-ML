The court unanimously overruled an appellate court decision in the case People v Roger Mentch"", writing: "" We hold that a defendant whose caregiving consisted principally of supplying marijuana and instructing on its use, and who otherwise only sporadically took some patients to medical appointments, cannot qualify as a primary caregiver under the Act and was not entitled to an instruction on the primary caregiver affirmative defense. We further conclude that nothing in the Legislature's subsequent 2003 Medical Marijuana Program (Health & Saf. Code,  11362.7 et seq.) alters this conclusion or offers any additional defense on this record. "" Full text of the decision may be found at  Prop 215 defines primary caregiver to be the ""individual designated by the [patient]... who has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing, health, or safety of that person."" According to the Court, these words "" imply a caretaking relationship directed at the core survival needs of a seriously ill patient, not just one single pharmaceutical need. "" The Court concluded, "" a defendant asserting primary caregiver status must prove at a minimum that he or she (1) consistently provided caregiving, (2) independent of any assistance in taking medical marijuana, (3) at or before the time he or she assumed responsibility for assisting with medical marijuana. "" The Court's ruling effectively limits the caregiver defense to relatives, personal friends and attendants, nurses, etc. In particular, it excludes its use by medical marijuana ""buyers' clubs,"" retail dispensaries and delivery services. The remaining legal defense for medical marijuana providers is to organize as patient cooperatives and collectives, which are legal under SB 420."

The entire 41 miles of river between Weitchpec and the river mouth has no roads and is completely isolated from any civilization.

I repeat this until I'm high enough, and then I'll throw it all back in the jar, throw the jar in my center console, run all my vents on high with the windows down to blow out the smell, chew some gum, and keep on driving. I never speed, I never light or exhale while stopped, and I only do it on roads I know really well. As far as risk goes, I'm certainly vulnerable to a search since I keep it in my unlocked center console. But it's very stealthy visually since the one-hitter looks like a cig. I could see getting caught if a cop saw the smoke blowing out of my car and smelled that it was pot. I could also see getting caught loading it if a cop thought I was dicking around with my phone and was looking for a texting while driving bust, which is why I usually don't look down while I'm loading it. Even though I think my system is pretty good, it's probably more risk than I should be taking on considering the consequences, but since the wife got all judgmental about my pot use, I find it more beneficial to do the majority of my smoking where she won't see it."

And then a post comes along that's about how stoners shouldn't be judgmental and that it's hypocritical to say those kinds of things against those who drink and smoke cigs. So because most problems stem from a lack of understanding, let's try to put this into perspective. For example, I drink but not nearly as often as I smoke weed and I much prefer to smoke weed than I do to drink. I don't smoke cigs because it's so bad for you, but I have friends that do and I have no problem with them when they do. I also have no problem with my straight edge friends and friends who don't smoke weed. This criticism of alcohol and cigs are not necessarily out of disrespect or hate for those things, but because there is a frustration felt by a lot of stoners that justice isn't being done. Even if you disregard all of the positive benefits of smoking weed mentally and physically, even if weed was as bad for you as alcohol or cigarettes, then there still should be no reason why it is illegal when other drugs like alcohol and tobacco are legal. There's a frustration that much more harmful substances like alcohol and tobacco are completely legal but due to corruption, misinformation/lies, xenophobia, corporate lobbying and their huge sacks of money, and authoritarian organizations like Above the Influence a great and relatively harmless substance like marijuana is illegal, that's not right, and it makes a lot of us frustrated and angry. So if you smoke cigs and you drink, next time there's a post about how much better weed is than those things (which I agree with) all of the upvotes are not saying that people that only smoke weed are better than you. I'm sure there are those who think that because they only smoke weed they are better than others, but most of the people are just taking out a very small part of their frustration by upvoting something that shows the unfair nature of marijuana prohibition. And if you are still offended after all of this, put away the alcohol, cigs, and chill the fuck out and smoke a blunt with me."

The study references various sources but fails to cite many updated or currently accepted studies. In addition to this, two major studies done with appropriate sample sizes came to an adverse conclusion. Even worse, the BLF cannot confirm a single case where marijuana caused lung cancer, but they can produce plenty where Tobacco did (their counter-variable). Not to mention they fail to provide any evidence for their claim. After long pages of data and scientific rambling a conclusion is poorly jumped to. Studies like that are what cause the anti-drug sentiment in the US, England, and the United Nations (SOCHUM)."

Drugs are wonderful for some peoples mental health, and if it is not it is not because of the drug but the reason for using it. What is making it bad is the ignorance that is perpetuated by their illegality. People are doing stupid doses, people are doing drugs in a way that harm themselves because they do not know how to do it right because of the illegality. Explain to me why, exactly, drugs are so bad. Cocaine and weed used to be legal, opiates used to be in kids cough medicine, and the world didn't fall apart into unproductive nonsense."
,reddit.com/r/changemyview,"If you wanted to argue ""I think legalization of pot is bad, CMV"", you could have done that, and it would be a completely different debate. Instead, you went with a title that basically insinuates that legalization advocates are either addicts or dealers. I think that specific argument has been disproven, and you've acknowledged as much (even here, 'substance abuse' is very different from 'addiction'; most college kids abuse alcohol at some point, but only a small percent are alcoholics).",[deleted],00-8-2013,,"Most of these are totally different points, though. If you wanted to argue ""I think legalization of pot is bad, CMV"", you could have done that, and it would be a completely different debate.

I think that specific argument has been disproven, and you've acknowledged as much (even here, 'substance abuse' is very different from 'addiction'; most college kids abuse alcohol at some point, but only a small percent are alcoholics). The benefits vs costs of marijuana, pot subculture, health effects, etc. have nothing to do with the stated topic of this CMV, which is a presumption about the nature of advocates. The one thing you do say that is relevant (""most people who smoke are involved in a lifestyle that revolves around it"") requires some pretty strong statistical support to back up and actually flies in the face of stated evidence (the number of people who support legalization is dramatically higher than the number of people who are regularly involved in the stoner lifestyle.)I'm not trying to convince you that you should support legalization, because that's not what this CMV is about (and that is a much, much more difficult point to argue). I'm trying to convince you that by assuming legalization advocates are either addicts or dealers, you're making a huge and measurably false presumption. Nothing more, nothing less."

The Hangover series certainly proves that. if you want to use an example that works, take cigarettes. modern smoking rates are way down from several decades ago. This is because of public health awareness campaigns as well as limiting tobacco advertisements, and disallowing tobacco use in public spaces. If cannabis was made legal, and was done so with a similar public health awareness campaign, rather than the misinformation we have now, where would the problem be?"

You are still making a subjective judgment based on notions defined by your cultural experience. Calling people ""suppressed"" or ""mistreated"" shows that you are being subjective, because other people literally do not see what they are doing as ""mistreating"". When you judge a murderer in a court of law, you are only being objective within the constraints of the law, and analysing a case as it relates to the laws in place. *The laws themselves are based on subjective ideologies.*Example: Let's say a guy gets arrested for having a lot of weed. It's illegal to possess marijuana, and you're a judge. You disagree with the law, but because you are a judge, you have to ""remain objective"" and sentence the guy based on the evidence that he has a giant bag of weed. Is the judge really being objective? Only in the context of ""obeying the law.""I tried to get at this in another comment, but are you saying that we are all ""bound"" to a universal law that falls in line with your concept of morality? That's the only possible way that everyone in the world could ""objectively"" say that female circumcision/outlawing homosexuality/etc are ""wrong"". We would need to be constrained by a set of undeniable principles to adhere to. And I would argue that no such thing actually exists."

The government allows alcohol to be legal, and people die from it daily. you could say the same about bleach, but the answer is not to put every aspect of humanity under federal supervision.
