They Want the United States to Essentially Be a Christian Theocracy.... Now I may be biased since I'm an secularist, Yes, you are. They Are Pro-WarThe Obama administration has started more wars and spent more money on war than the bush administration.

They Want to Tax the Rich Less and Tax the Poor and Middle-Class Moreonce again, your facts are simply inaccurate. The bush tax cuts made the tax code more progressive, not less. MarijuanaTraditionally, liberals are pro-marijuana and conservatives are against it. Democratic vice president is a proud drug warrior, as is most of his party. Prohibition was a progressive effort from the start. progressives are most certainly not traditionally pro-pot, or any other drug.  Conservatives seem to love locking people up and spending trillions on prisons. no, they love locking up criminals. Do you prefer to let them keep committing crimes? In addition, any reasonable human being should be against private for-profit prisonsThat's a reasonable position, as long as you're also against [for-profit prison guard unions.]() Otherwise you're just a giant hypocrite."
,reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion,"Also, we are wasting tax dollars and labour for the imprisonment of people who were using marijuana.",SuperMajesticMan,00-7-2015,,"I'm sorry but your post seems very... Inaccurate I guess. Barely anybody wants it legalized for the sole purpose of being a cure. Yes, it is one of the reasons that people want it legal, but you can't say people who want it legal are short minded. There are other reasons to legalization, such as how it *is* fairly safe. Better than alcohol, and that is legal. Also, we are wasting tax dollars and labour for the imprisonment of people who were using marijuana. Do you think it is right to ruin a person's life because of smoking a plant that makes the happy? We can also generate alot of money for us if it is sold in stores and taxed. Also, one of the reasons why tobacco was assumed safe is because we didn't have all the technology to analyze it that we do today. When we got this tech, we realized that it was bad. Now with pot, he have analyzed it and it is shown that it is not so bad. TL;DR being a cure is not the only reason people want it legalized, saying that people who want it legal are short minded is infactual and just doesn't make sense."
,reddit.com/r/changemyview,I think if Hillary clinton got caught smoking weed she should go to jail for as long as a black 25 year old with a criminal record.,natha105,00-3-2016,,"You know... There was a time when I probably would have agreed with you. In the 1960's, 1970's when we were really just entering the age of the large administrative state and were trying to figure out how to write huge laws of general application. I would have been a big proponent of writing broad laws and then allowing prosecutors to use their discretion in their application to make sure the intent of the law was done. Then we started locking up like half of all african american men, and more people than any other country in the world. We started to absolutely crush people's lives because they didn't want to sell a wedding cake to a gay couple. We expanded the scope of laws a thousand fold, and we got affluenza kid. We got teenagers being charged with manufacturing child pornography cause they sent they bf a topless pic and their teacher took their phone and searched it without their consent. So you know, I am completely done with the idea that special people shouldn't be treated the same way. I think if Hillary clinton got caught smoking weed she should go to jail for as long as a black 25 year old with a criminal record. Either the laws apply to the king as much as they do the lowest person, or we revert to the 1600's. Do you know we have more people in jail by a % of our population than Russia, Iran, or China?"
,reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion,Weed is being legalized in a few places (I don't live in one and it may take a while to see the effects).,CouldbeaRetard,00-6-2016,,"Drugs being illegal holds back research that could be done on them. How do you think most street drugs started? A lot, maybe all, of street drugs started out as medical application drugs but were taken out of use because they were too addictive and/or harmful. No research needs to be done on them. We know them well. The reason why street drugs have a reputation for unpredictability is because cheap-ass drug manufacturers cut random shit into their product.  Drugs being legal would make it easy for drug addicts to seek medical help without fear of arrest. There are already ways for addicts to seek treatment without criminal charges. The government actually *wants* to help you get off drugs.  he/she is going to use the more dangerous drug because of an inability to access the safer oneI think that would happen regardless of whether someones usual drug is legal or not. Your point is a valid one and commonly discussed. Weed is being legalized in a few places (I don't live in one and it may take a while to see the effects). Personally I think the only advantage to legalizing illicit drugs is to get revenue by taxing them. That's what they do with cigarettes, which is shit because cigarettes are so bad for peoples health. edit: spelling"
,reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion,That doesn't answer anything the poster saidIt offers an evidenced theory as to why cannabis has a medical effect on the human body and isn't simply an excuse to get stoned.,Spiel_Foss,00-10-2017,,"That doesn't answer anything the poster saidIt offers an evidenced theory as to why cannabis has a medical effect on the human body and isn't simply an excuse to get stoned. See the answer to the third question below.  The endocannabinoid system processes chemicals secreted by the human body. It functions and is useful even in somebody who doesn't use cannabis at all. Exactly. Medicine is used because something is wrong and a symptom needs to be addressed.   Claiming that the existence of chemicals in nature that our body can process does not mean our bodies developed in symbiosis with those chemicals. Which is why theories are explored and supported or discarded. Plant cannabinoids interact with humans in specific ways within the endocannabinoid system. So the symbiosis is simply an established fact. This symbiosis has known medical applications. Humans are just another mammal on a space rock who happened to have evolved an endocannabinoid system to regulate certain mammal body functions. Humans can also process external plant-derived cannabinoids to known therapeutic effects. On this human-inhabited space rock grows a cannabinoid plant which may be one of the first human domesticated plants stretching back into our unknown prehistory. I may be using the term ""evolve"" a little loosely, but the connection between the plant, the mammal and these specific chemicals occurred on a small space rock over a long period of time.  You're making the same mistake as those Intelligent Design folks. No need to be snarky, but you do raise a hilarious point. If one is to assume a cosmic watchmaker, then she designed da weed for a reason. Christians should be the biggest pot heads. God made grass after all. Or is that the infamous tree of the knowledge of good & evil that pisses god off so much?"
,reddit.com/r/changemyview,"When I had mine, despite knowing my family history and having a negative drug test for everything but marijuana, the psych hospital told my parents I had ""almost definitely"" smoked weed laced with PCP, which was ""the problem with dangerous street drugs"".",shibbyhornet28,00-10-2018,,"That's interesting. Just to give you some (perhaps overly personal) background, about half the males in my family have a single psychotic episode around the time they turn twenty with no clear environmental cause. When I had mine, despite knowing my family history and having a negative drug test for everything but marijuana, the psych hospital told my parents I had ""almost definitely"" smoked weed laced with PCP, which was ""the problem with dangerous street drugs"". That's all just to say that I'm super-sensitive about saying someone caused their own mental health problems, because, even from family members who had experienced the same condition, I had to listen to them tell me it was my fault for the months it took me to recover my normal patterns of thought. That article certainly makes more of a case than I've seen elsewhere, but I'm not sure I find it convincing. Here's the paragraph where they differentiate correlation/causation: Of course, association does not prove causation. However, one by one, alternative explanations have gradually been disproved.4 Patients do not start using cannabis to self-medicate their psychotic or prodromal symptoms or side-effects of drugs, but rather use it for the same reasons as the rest of the population, principally for its high. The risk of psychosis remains after controlling for personality disorder and use of other psychotogenic drugs. Some overlap between genes carrying susceptibility to schizophrenia and to drug use has been reported but insufficient to explain more than a fraction of the relationship.4This argument seems to based on self-reported motivations, controlling for diagnosed personality disorders, and controlling for other drug use. I'm not sure the fact that people express the desire to get high says much about why they're taking a substance, and I think there's a much broader range of ""sub-optimal"" mental states (that might lead one to self-medicate) than are regularly diagnosed. If they wanted to claim we knew there was still a correlation after controlling for, e. g., Borderline Personality Disorder that'd be one thing, but it seems like a stretch to say ruling that sort of thing out proves causation. edit: extraneous comma"

The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what Im saying? We knew we couldnt make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did."
,reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion,People downplay the mental effects of weed too much. It's the same thing with alcohol.,brainburner1d10t,00-8-2019,,"Thank you. People downplay the mental effects of weed too much. It's the same thing with alcohol. Not everyone who drinks will end up with problems (though many do) and they either deal with it or quit. It's literally the same thing with weed. And a large portion of people who smoke weed and might have some mental effects just continue smoking, so they never find out what those effects are. People say weed isn't addictive, but I can tell you there definitely is a craving sensation after you smoke for a while. Plus, you feel shitty without weed if you've been toking constantly for a long time. Isn't that the same thing as withdrawal? If not in a physical sense, then in a mental sense (due to lack of cannabinoids in the brain lifting your mood). Then again, since the brain is a physical organ, maybe it is physical. But I digress, some people can deal with it just fine - but there are downsides to consistent weed usage. Mainly mental. It makes you lazy as shit compared to if you were sober. It can lead to depression, anxiety, or just lowered motivation and drive in general. It's funny because all these kind weed downsides were commonly referenced by stoners themselves or stoner movies, songs, etc. I'm not saying that everybody will experience these things, but that they are a real possibility. This kind of reminds me of the backlash people would get when someone pointed out the deleterious effects of cigarettes or alcohol back in the day - I'm talking about decades ago. Most people said they were fine and that it was bullshit. But look where we are today. I think it'll take time until people calm down and actually assess the situation. I'm all for legalization and recreational use. But seriously, all things in moderation."
,reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion,"I'm so sick of people saying it's should be legal to smoke weed, weed is bad!",[deleted],00-12-2019,,"I'm so sick of people saying it's should be legal to smoke weed, weed is bad! it's not fucking healthy in anyway, the research that shows it doesn't do much bad to you is done on people well into adulthood, and those people generally are not tested for very long, and their brains are developed, so those research of course don't show many negative results because weed does damage to your brain that isn't as bad as when you use heroin that fucks you badly up instantly, now on the other hand, research on young people is the one that is showing the bad results, that are true i. e possibility of hindering or disrupting cognitive function and plenty of other bad stuff, basically if you're an adult it doesn't do that much bad to you but still can do bad stuff to you, it's very dangerous to young kid's brains and their development. Look weed should be allowed for dying cancer patient and other people who feel awful and just want to enjoy their last living moments peacefully, but how can you possibly justify legalizing weed when it has already shown that it does horrible damage to young peoples brains and i'm not talking about teens, peoples brains aren't fully developed until 25! and has bad effects on adults too? And to those who use alcohol death rates as a comparison, that doesn't make any fucking sense either!? alcohol is literal poison, it kills far more yes but that's because the effects of marijuana do not show as prominent as alcohol but it still does damage to your body and why try to justify that with the rates of poison that's only legal because of it's history and it's just common in todays culture. I know this was all over the place, but what I'm trying to get across is that weed is bad for you and statistics don't tell you the whole story because of the age range those researches are made on, but I sure as hell wouldn't want my future kids to be in a world where weed is easily reachable, but of course terminally ill people should have the chance to enjoy their last few living moments happy."
,reddit.com/r/changemyview,A lot of your argument seems to be based on a comparison between marijuana and other drugs.,Kitsunami,00-11-2019,,"A lot of your argument seems to be based on a comparison between marijuana and other drugs. But the problem is, most drugs aren't comparable to marijuana. You suppose that heroin would gain a level of illegal production to match what marijuana's has become, and I just can't wrap my head about why you think that might be. There aren't many heroin or meth users out there developing a hobbyist's interest in producing their drug. &#x200B;Or the idea that use of heroin or meth will maintain or increase at legalization, and I certainly don't believe that. The crowd that isn't doing meth and heroin aren't avoiding it because of legal repercussions. &#x200B;While legal marijuana almost definitely increased the rate of marijuana DUI cases, I find it a similarly hollow claim that heroin and meth users would cause more DUIs if it was legal. Perhaps some, but again, marijuana isn't like meth and heroin. Marijuana DUI cases are likely as high as they are because it's so easy for so many to get away with it. I don't necessarily believe that there's going to be thousands of meth heads mixed into my traffic if they only thing they have to fear is a DUI. &#x200B;Nor can the War on Drugs take credit for ancillary crimes found when chasing drugs. They would still be illegal, and we'd all agree it still should be pursued and stopped. There's no reason to think cops are powerless unless they are chasing drugs.&#x200B;At the end of the day though, none of it touches on the real true failings of the War on Drugs. In the world of narcotics law enforcement, there aren't victims. There are users and dealers. Treating drug addiction like a health problem and trying to solve it as such is proven to be more effective than punitive punishments, and you simply cannot balance a medical approach while at the same time pursuing criminal charges against drug users. Legalizing all drugs isn't going to solve the drug problem, it's a necessary first step to solutions that actually work."
,reddit.com/r/changemyview,"In the UK, marijuana is an illegal drug to distribute despite it being relatively safe compared to many other drugs (including alcohol and tobacco).",PurplePhury3412,00-3-2019,,"Some porn is ok, but theres some abuse porn, stretching, fisting, spitting, peeing, pooping, etc. Remember the 2 girls 1 cup. Would you want a 16 yr old masturbating to that thinking its normal?This is where my last line in the actual bit of the argument comes in about parents making sure their child is safe and informed. I agree there are genres of porn that you can stumble upon that promote unsafe ideas i. e. abuse, rape, etc. but generally you need to include those sorts of things as search terms in order to actually find them. Children should be taught this sort of thing is wrong and that consent and a condom are the golden two for any encounter they may have in the future. I also believe children are smart enough to realise things like 2 girls 1 cup aren't exactly the norm. There is always going to be ways for pre adults to view pornography, whether there is a law in place or not. Which is why instead of stigmatising it and discouraging conversation, we should promote safe and secure ways people can use pornography. In the UK, marijuana is an illegal drug to distribute despite it being relatively safe compared to many other drugs (including alcohol and tobacco). However, classifying it as similar to cocaine or meth has restricted the conversation on it and causes people to become misinformed about the effects of the drug and stigmatises those who use/sell it. *Despite the law, people will still consume marijauna. However, the law has caused misinformation regarding it's consumption which has lead to worse circumstances than the act itself.*"
