Pot is not the same thing as Prozac or Zoloft. While marijuana definitely has medical benefits it is not a wonder drug. It's also not as potent as some pharmaceuticals. Look at caffeine and amphetamines, just because the former is freely available doesn't mean the latter has no medical purpose, because while they share some similar effects they are really completely different drugs. Lumber: I found it hard to find real figures but taking one country as an example, Canada, I managed to determine that in 2001, the paper & pulp industry was worth about 18 billion and the rest of the wood industry (boards, panels, etc.) was about 13 billion. Certainly a massive shift towards hemp paper (which is great stuff) would harm the industry, but certainly not cripple it. Textile: Cotton is by far the most produced textile. Canvas would not be replaced, it is mostly made from cotton. You know that cotton is already incredibly cheap, right? Hemp wouldn't shake up the market that much. Alcohol: All of the pot smokers I know still drink (myself included). They are different things entirely. Pot will not replace wine, it will not replace beer, it will not replace liquor. Or have you forgotten that many Western countries have already banned or have begun to ban smoking in restaurants and bars? Chemicals: Yeah, but it won't cripple the industry, it'll help it or nothing. Biofuel: Hemp is worthless for biofuel when you compare it to algae."
,reddit.com/r/worldnews,Arguments where that criminal weed trade would appear in other area's in the outskirts and that the dealers could provide both hard and soft drugs (as stated in the article). The Wiet pas concerns mainly towns in the Netherlands that are close to a border.,obimk1,00-12-2010,,"As dutch guy living in one of the mentioned cities allow me to shed some light on this. Yesterday it was made public that the EU high court ruled that a ""Wiet pas"" was allowed according to EU 'law'. At the same day the city council of Maastricht made public that they were not in favor of the Wiet pas. Arguments where that criminal weed trade would appear in other area's in the outskirts and that the dealers could provide both hard and soft drugs (as stated in the article). The Wiet pas concerns mainly towns in the Netherlands that are close to a border. The mayors of these towns have the last say in this. The mayor of Eindhoven (my hometown) is in favor of the wiet pas in Eindhoven but with one strict condition;legalize the production of weed, also known as the illegal ""back door"" of a coffee shop. Make it controlled, a licensed activity, also eliminating the criminal activities. The mayor of Eindhoven wants to do this for Eindhoven, but until now this hasn't happened because it has national political consequences. The coalition of 3 parties that run the government are not all in favor of legalization of the back-door supply. However it has been noted that when the wiet pas is introduced, it will be a government sanctioned 'legal' document, so does that make wiet also a government sanctioned 'legal' drugs?2cts"
,reddit.com/r/Libertarian,":-p It is to laugh!> His administration has continued to raid medical marijuana facilities in states where it has been legalized, violating the Tenth Amendment. So you support Judicial Review (which does not exist in the Constitution) but oppose the Interstate Commerce Clause (which does exist in the Constitution)?",Zifnab25,00-6-2011,,"> Obama took our country to war without a declaration from Congress, then watched coolly as the sixty day limit in the War Powers Act came and went. You say that, and yet the Republican Congress has done absolutely nothing to stop him. Almost as though this is an empty and baseless allegation that ignores the authority the Presidency has already been assigned through numerous other authorizations of military force.> His health care legislation is being implemented in spite of a federal judge ruling it unconstitutional. The judge ruled it unconstitutional but failed to issue an injunction against the law. If he doesn't issue an injunction, the law continues implementation while it remains under appeal. Of course, there are more appellate courts that have found the legislation constitutional than unconstitutional... It's also worth noting that Judicial Review is - itself - (and you're going to laugh at this) UNCONSTITUTIONAL! you're really complaining that a judge with no Constitutional authority to stop a law from coming into effect stopped a law from coming into effect without explicitly stating he was doing so and accomplished this by exercising a power the Constitution doesn't grant him. :-p It is to laugh!> His administration has continued to raid medical marijuana facilities in states where it has been legalized, violating the Tenth Amendment. So you support Judicial Review (which does not exist in the Constitution) but oppose the Interstate Commerce Clause (which does exist in the Constitution)? Are you sure you're reading the US Constitution? Perhaps this is the confusion. I'm in the United States of America. What country are you in?> Separation of powers is a myth. A myth. This country is a dictatorship and has been at least since Lincoln, if not since Washington. I am living on Earth. The third planet from the sun. What planet are you living on?"
,reddit.com/r/AskReddit,"Agree, I usually get quite an odd look from people when I say we need to legalize more than just weed. However, they often overlook the other possibilities as to why we should legalize more than just weed.

However, they often overlook the other possibilities as to why we should legalize more than just weed. Particularly, the big two in my opinion, have nothing to do with raising money for the USFG. First, despite what the legal system actually says, the illegality establishes a stigmatization upon users that typically makes them fear seeking help or aid for their problem because they don't want to face legal consequences. This is my biggest concern, because even though I personally believe all drugs are safe in moderation, as long as we keep it illegal we undermine the ability for many people to seek the help that they need or desire. Sure, it may be because of their ignorance, but we aren't going around telling them ""it's okay, we will help you if needed"", instead we are persecuting them to the fullest extent of the law and throwing them in prison rather than provide them with aid. Second, the reason why there is any drug violence is because of the cartels and the underground market in itself. Will it sure exist? Sure, just like the moonshining business still exists. But it will be immensely weaker than it currently is, to the point where it is hardly noticeable at all by people. Undermining the providers and producers really begins to stop the violence associated with drug use. So, why do we have drugs illegal? Because of the violence associated and to help people avoid the risk of addiction. However, I don't know anyone that is going to randomly decide to become a cocaine addict just because cocaine is legal. So the argument that legalization opens access to more users is ridiculous to me. But what are we really doing? We are increasing violence and undermining the ability for many to get help. The only way to truly accomplish our goals behind the drug war is to abolish the drug war altogether."

I enjoy GJ's stance on medical Cannabis. But almost everything else, I don't agree with. So it's hard to vote for a man who I disagree with 9/10 times. But let's look at BO from another point. He has called for a few DEA raids on dispensaries, yes, this is true. But this is an election year, and he is more concerned with getting reelected. So if he knows that he needs to call for a few raids, and not push for decriminalization in order to gain a few moderate Repub voters, or swing voters (not sure of the exact term here); he's going to do that. Long story short, I think he's taking it easy. No use shooting himself in the foot. Now let's look at the next four years, supposing BO wins. He cannot be reelected, so I think there's a MUCH bigger chance for him to go along with decrim measures, and legalization issues. He's younger, he was a smoker, and he knows people care about the issue. The man isn't dumb, he knows how popular legalization is. But in his first term, and in an election year, he won't risk losing it by implementing those things. Let's get BO back in office for another 4 years, and see if we can get something out of him. With less pressure to get back in office, I would be EXTREMELY surprised if he didn't take the first major steps towards decriminalization or legalization. He has a better shot of winning than Johnson, and Obama seems to be ahead of Romney. Also, don't be dumb stoners. Go out and vote. I just got my application for absentee ballet while at school. I hope others follow through as well.:)"
,reddit.com/r/changemyview,"To take a particularly unjust analogy; a three strikes drug law could see a person using marijuana for chronic pain jailed to the same degree as your local mid level dealer. Obviously it's not really analogous to your position, but these kind of things do happen where strict mandatory sentencing guidelines exist irrespective of circumstances.",Chief_White_Halfoat5,00-10-2014,,"I think one of the issues we face when saying 'x reprehensible crime should result in people being locked away forever' is a problem of equivalency. Do you also believe that murder should result in life without parole? If not, are we as a society then saying that murder is less bad than molesting children? Insert other heinous crime and work your way through. Although it's unlikely that people who carry out such acts think them through logically, there's also an issue of deterrence of even worse crimes. If you're already potentially getting life without parole for molesting the child, why not just kill them as well? While there might be theoretical pros and cons for doing so for a criminal in that situation, you remove a potential deterrent for committing the additional crime. Another point is that the justice system is, in addition to its punitive nature, intended to function as a rehabilitation and treatment centre. If we discover that pedophilia is in some circumstances a treatable illness, what then do we say to these people? Sorry, we can fix you, but you can never come out? Or do we make allowance for the notion that they could be rehabilitated? Such a thing would not necessitate instant release - that would defeat the purpose of the punitive sentence, but could theoretically be incorporated into future parole bids. Obviously we're not there yet, but it is certainly a possible occurrence in the future. Finally I think you also have a problem with mandating sentences, or a specific sentence, for a crime. Each crime is different, in the circumstances of the accused, the impact on the victim and their family and the impact on society. Legislated mandatory sentences remove any leniency for any circumstances. To take a particularly unjust analogy; a three strikes drug law could see a person using marijuana for chronic pain jailed to the same degree as your local mid level dealer. Obviously it's not really analogous to your position, but these kind of things do happen where strict mandatory sentencing guidelines exist irrespective of circumstances."
