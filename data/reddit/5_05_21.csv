Mainstream doctors in major clinics and hospitals get federal funding and therefore makes it difficult (if not impossible) to conduct widespread research and legalized prescriptions. [The bureaucracy about receiving these federal funds is what makes SKILLED and WELL-EDUCATED doctors]() (if you think that only the best doctors come from the western world you must be more ignorant than you come across) set up shop privately for research. [There are marijuana drugs that are FDA-approved drugs based on research conducted by leaders in their field such as in Ohio.]() Which goes back to my OP about the government bodies responsible for being a barrier for legalization or even rescheduling **even though the FDA** has already approved a marijuana drug! FYI cocaine is not even a schedule 1 drug. Do you call it an alternative medicine? How can they justify having cocaine as a schedule 2 substance and still have an FDA approved drug with a medical use for it listed as a schedule 1? Nobody is saying marijuana is a cure-for-all. You made that up. Not all drugs need to be cures. Medicine is not equal to a cure. Medicine can be used to alleviate debilitating symptoms, such as in the example above. You also refer to marijuana as an alternative medicine because that's what pharmaceutical companies over decades have insisted on calling anything else that isn't orthodox or doesn't come from their labs and has ultimately has a negative connotation of lacking efficacy, WHICH ISN'T TRUE! Whatever ""boring science"" (only 2 words I agree with you on) being conducted by NDCP and NIDA is based on POLITICAL GREED of wanting to stay in office and being beholden to CAPITALISTIC self-interest lobbying groups including conservative and pharmaceutical and companies (see OP links) and their history of spreading lies and fear about the effects of marijuana."
