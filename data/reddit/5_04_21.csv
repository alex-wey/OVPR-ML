There's much more money to be made off an illegal substance that is worth as much as gold, and can be spun out of thin air if you have land and power. Retards don't see a tax on it, so they think legalizing it somehow creates wealth. These retards have thought about how much it costs TAXPAYERS for the drug war. But not about how much money it makes POLITICIANS using that taxpayer seed money for their class warfare and dirty tricks bag. The CIA without marijuana illegal, may be out of business. Millions of jobs would be lost, documented and undocumented, in addition to all the retail sector and restaurant sector that relies on people rich off the drug trade. We should legalize it, but don't debate using the logic of a retard. It should be legalized because the majority of the people want it legal, and we are taxed. no taxation without representationthe car your drug dealer buys wont get bought, the rehab center won't receive their grant, the cop on the marijuana task force will be collecting unemployement, the judges, the lawyers, all the related prison industry.. you have no clue how much of this is class warfare and has no foundation in democracy at all."

So here it is:By watching President-Elect Obama's successful campaign and hearing him voice his opinions on numerous issues, it has become evident to me that he understands the ineffectiveness of any campaign based on fear tactics and lies. Much of Barack's platform has been constructed on the assumption that the American people are intelligent and make the best decisions when fully informed on an issue, and for that I am grateful. With an understanding of this creed, I ask that President Obama urgently address America's true priorities in its war on drugs. The true epidemic in America today is Methamphetamine addiction among teenagers in rural communities. The help that is required is not an impossibly expensive DEA operation, but an educational and treatment investment in our nations human infrastructure. I have found an ideal source of funding for this operation. Divert all resources from all anti-marijuana operations being conducted by DEA and any other federal agency. Sovereignty on this issue should lie with the state, if an individual is morally opposed to the regulations in a given state, they can easily move to a state with laws that suit them. Voter initiatives in several states have shown the undeniable will of the people. It is supposed to be the duty of the government to serve the will of the people, not dictate it. Change is in the air, our current policies on have made illegal drugs more accessible to children than alcohol, built empires from drug money, and massively inflated America's private prison industry. Now that we are starting with a clean slate on so many issues, let us also look beyond the talking points on this issue and do the right thing for America."

RJ Reynolds and the other tobacco companies would essentially be given the keys to the kingdom and it would be made significantly difficult to compete with them. Regulations would also limit the amount of THC content. And the taxes would be likely to be very, very high. Why are they taxing it? They tax tobacco to reduce usage. If that's going to be the reason, supporting legalization at all hits a roadblock right there. They tax alcohol because it causes significant damage to society. Again, if this is the reason behind the taxation of marijuana then the proposal to legalize has its own defeat written into it. If they're taxing it to raise money for unrelated government programs and simply putting the money raised into the general fund... well, especially in California, the taxes will be very steep and will only climb. With no need to account for the programs the funds are going towards, it will be used as the funding for nearly everything. And growing your own would most likely just result in charges of tax evasion, like if you run your car on homemade biofuel."

And the drug war is a continually losing battle on the part of the government. I'm all for the prevention of heroin and hard drug use on a whole, but marijuana should not fall into that category. In fact, the drug war is driving more people towards hard drugs than marijuana ever has. I'm a young guy, and I know a lot of people who abuse prescription and house hold drugs because marijuana can be difficult to get your hands on when the town is dry, which is often around here. The drug war is actually escalating hard drug use as well and empowering cartels, as I'm sure you all know. Yesterday, there was a /r/Marijuana post from a micro-economics book on this topic. If you understand elasticity in economics, you'd agree that drug use is an inelastic product (simply put, it's ""recession proof."") Therefore, by making it more difficult to obtain drugs, you are effectively raising the price and creating MORE revenue for dealers, who are then more likely to expand their businesses. This is true of both hard drugs and marijuana, but is only truly dangerous in the case of hard drugs as they get more dangerous as they get more expensive. A full-blown legalization of Marijuana in California IS a major turning point. If it were to happen there, the federal government has to make a move. Perhaps a review of the constitutionality by the Supreme Court or even an executive order. Although, on the topic of executive order, I think it's best that our President completely ignore the issue for the time being. Addressing it can only hurt his popularity at this point, and he needn't be concerned with it while the country is already facing the issue of large-scale health care reform. Considering that the executive office is the ""enforcer"" among the branches of government, it will have to be addressed by Obama if legalization happened in California. However, he would probably have to side with the federal laws concerning it, so it'd be best if he ignored it altogether and let the judicial branch hash out the legality once again before taking action."

However, the Controlled Substances Act gives the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), as successor agency of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, great power over rescheduling decisions.> After the DEA accepts the filing of a petition, the agency must request from the HHS Secretary ""a scientific and medical evaluation, and his recommendations, as to whether such drug or other substance should be so controlled or removed as a controlled substance."" The Secretary's findings on scientific and medical issues are binding on the DEA. The HHS Secretary can even unilaterally legalize cannabis: ""[I]f the Secretary recommends that a drug or other substance not be controlled, the Attorney General shall not control the drug or other substance."" 21 U.

Most figures I've seen also show that legalizing marijuana actually has a curbing effect on its use anyway, so I personally do not believe it to cause a pandemic of blazed up idiots. My view of the current marijuana legality parallels that to the American prohibition of the early 1900's in that many people do it, and it is only creating crime for the reason that it is illegal. If its a problem of being a gateway drug they should outlaw tobacco products all together. Edit:Having said that, I don't smoke weed and have never found myself with a need for it in my own life. Not looking down on those who do, I really couldn't care less, I have just never found the need. I do however look down on those who let it consume their lives in the same way that we look down on alcoholics and that one douche that talks about ""how much they drink all the time and get stupid drunk.""

So, rather than going after real criminals actually hurting others, they are targeting specific racial groups for committing victimless crimes, while essentially giving the status quo group passes for committing the same crimes. Can you imagine how fast stop and frisk would disappear if police were targeting white kids? Furthermore, it's not necessarily that the poor commit crimes at higher rates, it's that they lack the means to properly defend themselves. Public defenders are overworked and interior to paid representation. When middle class or wealthy kids get caught with weed, they don't end up with criminal records which hurt their chances of employment and higher education. And this is where the white privilege comes in, as all white people, irrespective of economic status, are given a pass with stop and frisk, so only poor minorities end up suffering. Whites who would otherwise end up like poor blacks and Latinos end up avoiding harassment and arrests which ruin their lives simply because of their skin color."

Seeing the point above, there is a risk for numerous long term issues.> If someone wants to wake 'n' bake or just stare at their ceilings and come up with ideas that are so stupid and then laugh at it later, what's wrong with that? Assuming a person is only responsible for themselves (IE no children) and also that they are able to take care of themselves, I agree. However, in many cases (at least those familiar to me), the wake & bake stoners are living off their parents or loved ones. In addition to having an honest understanding of the risks, it's important to have an honest look at who else this impacts. Specifically where those relationships are not easily dissolveable."

There can be more than one gateway drug. For example, Vicodin is a gateway drug into heroin and fentanyl. Marijuana was traditionally a gateway drugs into shrooms, LSD, and other psychedelics.2. Marijuana is illegal. When people use it, they learn how to find drug dealers in their city, how to avoid getting caught, how to find communities of like minded users, etc. Tobacco and alcohol are legal drugs. They are much more easily available. Stealing booze from your parents doesn't teach you how to find illegal drugs the way using pot does. 3. The culture around using tobacco and alcohol was traditionally very different than marijuana. Tobacco was everywhere. Like drinking coffee, it was just something people did. The same applied to alcohol. Many people drank alcohol as part of casual social events from house parties to spending the day with their children. It was a very mainstream drug. Marijuana was very outside of the mainstream. People who smoked it, smoked it with a purpose. Many people picked up alcohol and tobacco by simply going with the crowd, but marijuana smokers had to specifically choose to smoke pot. They had to swim against the current of public opinion. And the people who were willing to do that for pot were often willing to go one step farther into other psychedelic drugs. Obviously, this has changed a lot since pot has become more popular. Marijuana is now legal in some places. It has it's own semi-mainstream culture where the goal is to smoke pot. Before, the goal was to ""expand your mind"" and pot was just the most easily available tool to do that. And now that pot is popular, it's a lot easier for people who tend to be followers to pick it up. Before, it was just independent minded people. So maybe pot isn't a gateway drug anymore, but traditionally (or at least until the late 90's/early-2000's), it was the main gateway drug into harder drug use. Now that the culture has shifted, it's not what it used to be. But it's not *complete* nonsense either."

Influenza I believe is one of a few physical symptoms for smoking. What makes marijuana unique from many drugs is how it's not chemically addictive. Many hear this and shorten the phrase to ""it's not addictive"" for the sake of their bias agenda. However, it is psychologically addictive, very psychologically addictive. Our brain works like this: if something makes you happy and you're in need for happiness, keep doing it. For those in need of happiness, weed is a very dangerous habit that generates those stereotypes that do nothing but smoke all the time and cannot quit. This is similar to other psychological addictions that are also overlooked, like sex addiction or various food eating disorders. It's a serious problem, but the bias will dismiss it as not dangerous because it's simply not chemically addictive and physical side effects are so low. Of course, for the wrong people the consequence can be observed and documented to be severe with the wrong time for wrong people. I could go on a longer rant, but nothing more needs to be said. Weed isn't as bad for you as say anything else, but that's not a legitimate argument when discussing whether it is or is not dangerous, it simply is with an irresponsible user, which sums up majority of individuals that don't know this overly common knowledge."

If you only smoke a little at a given time you'll be far less annoying and far more connected to people who aren't high. This is important for any kind of productivity involving other people who aren't your equally stoned peers. Weed makes you miss it when it's gone. I can't count the number of times I've been high as a kite and demonstrated to myself precisely why I should smoke less, only to go right back to my rose colored glasses when I ran out. Have boundaries. Weed robs the people who love you of your actual self. People who are high every waking minute have one major blind spot: all the people who know you best, know your moods and your mind and temperament, namely your parents, can draw a clear line on the calendar between the you that you naturally grew up to be, and the you that is now always high. This change may not be the worst thing in the world, but do yourself and your parents a favor and spend at least some time every week with a clear head. Weed exacerbates productivity issues. If you are a procrastinator, if you're self destructive, if you are constantly in denial of your faults and responsibilities, well marijuana might as well have been tailored by Satan himself specifically for you. You aren't doing yourself any favors, zero, with an every day habit. TL;DR Have boundaries:Don't get stoned to oblivion unless you don't have things to do. Give yourself and your loved ones days where you are just you. Remember why these things are important when you aren't high and you really want some weed. Stay vigilant about the parts of your personality that will be particularly susceptible to being manipulated by marijuana in a negative way. And for Christ's sake legalize pot already, sugar kills people every day. Just because a substance requires responsibility to be used properly is not a reason to do prohibition."

Legalization allows for study, and more advancement in the pharmaceutical sciencesYou've kind of addressed the first point - but I think a discussion can be had on the role of government in regulating our own private behavior. There's a massive difference between jailing black kids for possession, and having so many kids in prison that they wait months for a trial, and prosecuting individuals who legally purchase marijuana and illegally distribute it. But you've not at all addressed the medicinal benefits - the FDA already has approved marijuana based drugs for child epilepsy (I believe it's epilepsy). There are preliminary studies which show THC as a compound which can treat cancer. It's worth looking into, but we can't if it's illegal. I also have an anecdotal story around ""medicinal"" marijuana. I suffered a major complex bone fracture in the arm, and it took weeks for the medical system to get its shit together and for me to get a surgery to fix it. During that time, illegally-obtained marijuana helped me manage both my pain and injury-related anxiety enough to *keep my job.* Without it, I more than likely would have lost my job, lost my income, been rendered unable to pay for medical bills, and probably would have slipped into poverty. Using doctor-prescribed oxycodone rendered me unable to work or drive, and taking nothing rendered me unable to *move.*"
